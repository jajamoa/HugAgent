6,Excellent! We're now ready to begin the interview about urban zoning policies. Take your time with each response and provide as much detail as you'd like. Let's start with our first question.,Okay
7,To what extent do you support or oppose upzoning policies that allow for higher density housing in traditionally single-family neighborhoods? Please explain your reasoning.,"As the populations across all cities increase, the housing demands are very hard to keep up with. There are apartments that have no vacancies making it hard for people who need to find a home. I used to live close to a college and that also really affected pricing and home availability. The college students drove up the prices and made less homes available to the residents in my city."
8,"What do you think are the most significant impacts, positive or negative, of increasing housing density in residential neighborhoods?",There will be more homes which will give people more options of where to live. I think it will also drive the prices down as less people will be competing for each housing unit. I think the positives outweigh the negatives.
9,How do you think upzoning policies might affect housing affordability in urban areas?,I think that with all the new construction the affordability will be better as there will be more homes than people looking to move. i think that lack of upzoning is what keeps home and apartment prices going up as we are all competing for the same home resources.
10,What impact do you believe increased housing density might have on neighborhood character and quality of life?,"I think that quality of life will be the same. The character will be more modern, maybe even a bit industrial or overcrowded like bigger cities and downtown areas. However, I think that with increased housing we might see more businesses migrate and thus create a positive change in the economy of that neighborhood/s."
11,How do you think upzoning might affect transportation systems and traffic congestion in cities?,"It will make congestion worse. A lot of the areas in my city are already crowded regardless of the day or time. It will add a lot to commute times. There are also more accidents on the road in my city than 10 years ago so as upzoning happens and more people move, then there will more crowds and traffic."
12,What role do you believe local government should play in regulating housing development and density?,I think my local government needs to do a lot of things as I do not agree with a lot of what they are doing and I think they should be limited to the bare essentials.
13,How might environmental concerns factor into decisions about urban density and zoning?,"I'm concerned about the environment, but at the same time, we can't avoid building and housing people, so it must be done. However, ordinances should still be followed to make sure they work within the environmental limits that are currently in place."
14,"What economic effects, both positive and negative, might result from changing zoning laws to allow more multi-family housing?",The positive is that there would be more revenue in the areas with the new housing as there will be more people in that area living and spending time there. I cannot think of a negative impact.
15,How do you think the interests of current residents versus future residents should be balanced when making zoning decisions?,"I think that current residents should be heard, but they do not own the city nor all the land, so at the end of the day, their voices shouldn't be at the top. What needs to be the determining factor is housing needs and projected data."
16,What role do you think social equity and access to opportunity play in discussions about zoning and housing policy?,I do not understand. Can you explain it in another way?
17,How would you describe the relationship between Housing demand and Support for Upzoning? Is it a strong or weak connection? Does it have a positive effect (increasing it) or a negative effect (decreasing it)? How strong is this effect?,"Anytime I see there is a zoning change request people get up in arms about how they do not want to build more housing and how it will be an eye sore and diminish home values. So, it has a negative effect with local homeowners. Other people and businesses seem to favor it more."
18,"What do you think are the main causes of Support for Upzoning, and how certain are you about these relationships? Please also indicate if these influences are positive (increasing) or negative (decreasing).",The need for more homes. The lack of available homes. The lack of square footage which demands upzoning. The needs of my city are only growing. I think those of us who support it do so because we see the need for more affordable housing.
19,"Is the effect of Decrease in housing competition on Support for Upzoning immediate, or does it take time to develop? Does it have a positive effect (increasing it) or a negative effect (decreasing it)? How strong is this effect?","It takes time to develop as the upzoning areas will not be built overnight nor will they immediately be full to capacity and immediately decrease housing competition. It will slowly develop as people move, go to college, separate, etc and have changes that necessitate moving."
20,"Is the effect of Positive impact outweighs negative on Support for Upzoning immediate, or does it take time to develop? Does it have a positive effect (increasing it) or a negative effect (decreasing it)? How strong is this effect?","The positive takes times to see as we won't see how a neighborhood performs until we see the results after 1 or 2 years to see the actual effect on traffic, density, home availability. etc."
21,"Would small changes in New Construction lead to noticeable changes in Support for Upzoning, or would it take larger shifts? Does it have a positive effect (increasing it) or a negative effect (decreasing it)? How strong is this effect?",Thanks for watching!
22,How confident are you that changes in Neighborhood character lead to changes in Support for Upzoning? Does it have a positive effect (increasing it) or a negative effect (decreasing it)? How strong is this effect?,I think that as younger people move into older neighborhoods the support for upzoning increases.
23,"Would small changes in Traffic Congestion lead to noticeable changes in Support for Upzoning, or would it take larger shifts? Does it have a positive effect (increasing it) or a negative effect (decreasing it)? How strong is this effect?","It would take larger shifts. My city has a lot of horrible roads, lots of one way streets (in small areas but also in more congested areas). My city/state has a lot to improve on when it comes to traffic congestion."
24,How would you describe the relationship between Urban Density and Support for Upzoning? Is it a strong or weak connection? Does it have a positive effect (increasing it) or a negative effect (decreasing it)? How strong is this effect?,I think the more urban density the more support as you have a lot more people looking for a home. It is a positive effect as it allows upzoning to occur.
25,"Would small changes in Increased revenue lead to noticeable changes in Support for Upzoning, or would it take larger shifts? Does it have a positive effect (increasing it) or a negative effect (decreasing it)? How strong is this effect?",Larger shifts. I don't think anyone in my city would care about small changes in the economy or revenue.
26,"Would small changes in Future residents' interests lead to noticeable changes in Support for Upzoning, or would it take larger shifts? Does it have a positive effect (increasing it) or a negative effect (decreasing it)? How strong is this effect?",I don't think it would matter. People who oppose upzoning will always be opposed regardless of how future residents act or are perceived.
27,"Is the effect of Housing needs on Support for Upzoning immediate, or does it take time to develop? Does it have a positive effect (increasing it) or a negative effect (decreasing it)? How strong is this effect?",It takes time to develop as the needs of the city need to change drastically for it to be considered.
28,How would you describe the relationship between Negative effect on local homeowners and Support for Upzoning? Is it a strong or weak connection? Does it have a positive effect (increasing it) or a negative effect (decreasing it)? How strong is this effect?,"Strong connection of homeowners opposing upzoning as they are always complaining in the local reddit, neighborhood and even community talks."
29,"Does Need for more homes have a positive or negative effect on Support for Upzoning, and how significant is this effect? Does it have a positive effect (increasing it) or a negative effect (decreasing it)? How strong is this effect?",Need for more homes has a positive effect as it directly benefits upzoning and the companies that want to develop those areas. it is a strong effect as the companies building these apartments are money hungry.
30,How confident are you that changes in Positive effect of upzoning lead to changes in Support for Upzoning? Does it have a positive effect (increasing it) or a negative effect (decreasing it)? How strong is this effect?,Not very confident
31,"Would small changes in Neighborhood performance evaluation lead to noticeable changes in Support for Upzoning, or would it take larger shifts? Does it have a positive effect (increasing it) or a negative effect (decreasing it)? How strong is this effect?","It would take larger shifts. Homeowners are very resistant to changes in their neighborhood, traffic commute, streets, etc."
32,"What factors affect Population growth, and which ones have the strongest influence? Please also indicate if these influences are positive (increasing) or negative (decreasing).",Job and education opportunities. With a lot of jobs and education opportunities more people will want to move which will affect population growth
33,How would you describe the relationship between Single-family neighborhoods and Support for Upzoning? Is it a strong or weak connection? Does it have a positive effect (increasing it) or a negative effect (decreasing it)? How strong is this effect?,"Single family neighborhoods are always opposed to upzoning. They want their city and neighborhoods to remain quiet, safe, etc. So there is no connection there."
34,"Would small changes in Lower housing prices lead to noticeable changes in Support for Upzoning, or would it take larger shifts? Does it have a positive effect (increasing it) or a negative effect (decreasing it)? How strong is this effect?",Pricing would not change the support.
35,"Would small changes in Time required for development lead to noticeable changes in Support for Upzoning, or would it take larger shifts?
