Question Number,Question,Answer
1,To what extent do you support or oppose the widespread deployment of surveillance cameras in public spaces? Please explain your reasoning.,I oppose it as there is a lot or racial and gender bias.
2,"What do you think are the most significant impacts, positive or negative, of increasing surveillance camera coverage in urban areas?","I don't think there are any impacts. It seems any time surveillance cameras are used, the perpetrator is blurry or not visible. So it makes no difference. Then when a crime happens the police can somehow never find the perp."
3,How do you think surveillance technologies might affect public safety and crime rates?,I don't think it makes a difference in crime rates or public safety
4,What impact do you believe increased surveillance might have on personal privacy and individual liberties?,People will want to go out less.
5,How do you think surveillance camera systems might affect community trust and police-community relations?,I think it will make it worse as police are already seen as being widely ineffective and too brutal when they shouldn't be.
6,What role do you believe government should play in regulating surveillance technologies and data collection?,I think it needs to stay out of it
7,How might technological concerns about accuracy and reliability factor into decisions about surveillance systems?,It will dissuade people with good intentions but it would not deter lawmakers or city officials as they have already enacted lots of surveillance in certain areas.
8,"What economic effects, both positive and negative, might result from investing in widespread surveillance infrastructure?",I do not know.
9,How do you think the interests of law enforcement versus privacy advocates should be balanced when making surveillance policy?,I think privacy advocates should carry more weight. There is too much police brutality and overreach and they cannot be trusted to have the public's best interest at hand.
10,What role do you think social equity and potential bias play in discussions about surveillance technologies?,"I think minorities and organization for minorities see there is a lot of potential for bias. Others (police, city, officials, etc) will not care."
11,"Does Racial bias have a positive or negative effect on Support for surveillance camera, and how significant is this effect? Does it have a positive effect (increasing it) or a negative effect (decreasing it)? How strong is this effect?",Very negative strong effect. It will lead to more imprisonments without due process simply because you were caught on tape at the scene of a crime at the time surrounding a crime.
12,What causes changes in Support for surveillance camera? Are these influences strong or weak?,I don't think people's support changes. I think most people have their mind made up.
13,"Does Crime solving capabilities of police have a positive or negative effect on Support for surveillance camera, and how significant is this effect? Does it have a positive effect (increasing it) or a negative effect (decreasing it)? How strong is this effect?",I don't know whether it is a factor but it should not. Police are highly ineffective even when they have evidence.
14,How confident are you that changes in Community trust lead to changes in Support for surveillance camera? Does it have a positive effect (increasing it) or a negative effect (decreasing it)? How strong is this effect?,I think community trust can play a difference depending on how big or small the community is.
15,"Does Surveillance Technologies have a positive or negative effect on Support for surveillance camera, and how significant is this effect? Does it have a positive effect (increasing it) or a negative effect (decreasing it)? How strong is this effect?",They probably have a positive effect as these companies with the technologies want to be able to use them and win contracts from local governments to profit off of them.
16,"Would small changes in People with good intentions lead to noticeable changes in Support for surveillance camera, or would it take larger shifts? Does it have a positive effect (increasing it) or a negative effect (decreasing it)? How strong is this effect?",I don't it would change anything
17,"Would small changes in Privacy Advocates lead to noticeable changes in Support for surveillance camera, or would it take larger shifts? Does it have a positive effect (increasing it) or a negative effect (decreasing it)? How strong is this effect?",It would take larger shifts to help privacy advocates have a chance as the government and these technology companies want to exploit our privacy and they have tons of money to be able to get it done.
18,How confident are you that changes in Trust in Law Enforcement lead to changes in Support for surveillance camera? Does it have a positive effect (increasing it) or a negative effect (decreasing it)? How strong is this effect?,Very confident. I have seen how ineffective the police are in my city and it greatly has diminished my support for surveillance. I do not trust them with more information.
19,How confident are you that changes in City officials lead to changes in Support for surveillance camera? Does it have a positive effect (increasing it) or a negative effect (decreasing it)? How strong is this effect?,Very confident. I have seen how ineffective local government can be and it greatly has diminished my support for surveillance. I do not trust them with more information.
20,How would you describe the relationship between Potential Bias and Support for surveillance camera? Is it a strong or weak connection? Does it have a positive effect (increasing it) or a negative effect (decreasing it)? How strong is this effect?,The potential of bias creates a very negative effect and it is a very strong connection
21,"Is the effect of Negative effect on Support for surveillance camera immediate, or does it take time to develop? Does it have a positive effect (increasing it) or a negative effect (decreasing it)? How strong is this effect?",It is immediate as most people in the community already have a perception of local law enforcement and their actions
22,How confident are you that changes in Effectiveness of police lead to changes in Support for surveillance camera? Does it have a positive effect (increasing it) or a negative effect (decreasing it)? How strong is this effect?,Very confident. If we trusted the police we could trust them to use surveillance justly. But we cannot.
23,How would you describe the relationship between Positive Effect and Support for surveillance camera? Is it a strong or weak connection? Does it have a positive effect (increasing it) or a negative effect (decreasing it)? How strong is this effect?,Weak connection as I do not know of any data that would support the need for survelliance.
24,How would you describe the relationship between Exploitation of privacy and Support for surveillance camera? Is it a strong or weak connection? Does it have a positive effect (increasing it) or a negative effect (decreasing it)? How strong is this effect?,Exploitation of privacy has a negative effect as it makes people feel like targets even when they should not be.
25,"What do you think are the main causes of Surveillance cameras in public spaces, and how certain are you about these relationships? Please also indicate if these influences are positive (increasing) or negative (decreasing).","I think it's just the city trying to crack down on anything and everything. I consider it an overreach, so it is negative"
26,How confident are you that changes in Support for Surveillance Cameras lead to changes in Support for surveillance camera? Does it have a positive effect (increasing it) or a negative effect (decreasing it)? How strong is this effect?,That does not make sense
27,"Would small changes in Trust in Local Government lead to noticeable changes in Support for surveillance camera, or would it take larger shifts? Does it have a positive effect (increasing it) or a negative effect (decreasing it)? How strong is this effect?",It would take larger shifts as a lot of us are unhappy with local government and the overreaches they are trying to enact.
28,"Would small changes in Immediate effect lead to noticeable changes in Support for surveillance camera, or would it take larger shifts? Does it have a positive effect (increasing it) or a negative effect (decreasing it)? How strong is this effect?",It would take larger shifts as it will take a lot to change perceptions
