    "housing_experience": "I moved out of my parent's house 3 years ago when me and my boyfriend decided to move in together. We moved to an apartment in the outskirts of my city. It took us about two months to find a place to apply at due to income limitations, income qualifications, etc. Previous to that, I had not moved away from home and lived with my parents and two siblings. My parents and siblings and myself had lived at the home we rented for about 10 years at the time.",
