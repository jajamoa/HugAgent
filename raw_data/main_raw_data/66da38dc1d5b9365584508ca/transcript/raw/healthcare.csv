Question Number,Question,Answer
1,To what extent do you support or oppose universal healthcare policies that provide government-funded healthcare coverage for all citizens? Please explain your reasoning.,I support it 100%.
2,"What do you think are the most significant impacts, positive or negative, of implementing a universal healthcare system?","I think everybody would have an option to be able to get health care at that point, which is not available right now. And that would be a big positive increase for America."
3,How do you think universal healthcare policies might affect healthcare quality and accessibility?,"I don't think universal healthcare would affect the healthcare quality, but I think if they keep, you know, the standard insurance companies in place, that will hurt the healthcare."
4,What impact do you believe a universal healthcare system might have on medical innovation and research?,I don't believe it changed the innovation and research part of it any at all. I think that people genuinely want to help people. The ones that are finding the cures and the ones that just want money can get lost.
5,How do you think universal healthcare might affect the economic burden on individuals and families?,I don't think universal healthcare will affect any kind of burden at all.
6,What role do you believe government should play in healthcare delivery and financing?,"I think the government should pay 100% of your health care because you pay out of every check. You know, you're paying your taxes, you're paying Social Security, if you're working for yourself, you're paying self-employment, they're taking the 25% of your money for something."
7,How might healthcare provider concerns factor into decisions about universal healthcare implementation?,"Like I already said, health care providers, if they don't want to provide health care for people, unless they can make a fortune, then they need to go somewhere else. They're in the wrong business."
8,"What economic effects, both positive and negative, might result from transitioning to a universal healthcare system?","I think the biggest benefit would all be positive and it would be people being able to get medical treatment and the only few negative side effects would be, like I said, maybe there might be a few plastic surgeons that might move out of the country."
9,How do you think the interests of taxpayers versus healthcare consumers should be balanced when making healthcare policy?,I think that's a moot point. I think a healthy society works better so you got more taxpayers to pay the burden and you know if they're sick people then the taxpayers are having to pay more anyways to make up for the sick people.
10,What role do you think social equity and access to care play in discussions about healthcare policy?,"I don't know. I think social, you know, inequity is just, it's all over the place and it's not any one specific group, but I think everybody deserves health care."
11,"Is the effect of Support for universal policies on Support for universal healthcare immediate, or does it take time to develop? Does it have a positive effect (increasing it) or a negative effect (decreasing it)? How strong is this effect?",I think the effect is strong and it's immediate.
12,"What might lead to increases or decreases in Support for universal healthcare, and how significant are these effects? Please also indicate if these influences are positive (increasing) or negative (decreasing).","I think if they said they were going to try to keep regular health care and universal health care as two separate institutions, that would be a problem. I probably would not support universal health care as much."
13,"Is the effect of Positive impact on America on Support for universal healthcare immediate, or does it take time to develop? Does it have a positive effect (increasing it) or a negative effect (decreasing it)? How strong is this effect?","Yeah, I think the effect would be immediate for the positive impact on America. I think within a year. That's pretty immediate."
14,How would you describe the relationship between Healthcare quality and Support for universal healthcare? Is it a strong or weak connection? Does it have a positive effect (increasing it) or a negative effect (decreasing it)? How strong is this effect?,"I think right now, you know, everybody assumes they're getting better quality because they're paying more, but that's not going to be the case. If more people are healthy, the quality of life is just going to be better."
15,"Does Standard insurance companies have a positive or negative effect on Support for universal healthcare, and how significant is this effect? Does it have a positive effect (increasing it) or a negative effect (decreasing it)? How strong is this effect?","I think standard insurance has got a negative impact on support for universal health care because standard insurance is pushing the thought that if you don't pay a lot, you get crap treatment."
16,How would you describe the relationship between Government responsibility in healthcare and Support for universal healthcare? Is it a strong or weak connection? Does it have a positive effect (increasing it) or a negative effect (decreasing it)? How strong is this effect?,"I think everybody's afraid of what the government's gonna do and who they're gonna allow or not allow. And that turns into a problem because they put numbers on, you know, who can get treatment."
17,How confident are you that changes in Universal Healthcare Implementation lead to changes in Support for universal healthcare? Does it have a positive effect (increasing it) or a negative effect (decreasing it)? How strong is this effect?,"I'm pretty confident, I'd say, you know, it'll lead to positive results, and I'm highly confident."
18,"Would small changes in Access to medical treatment lead to noticeable changes in Support for universal healthcare, or would it take larger shifts? Does it have a positive effect (increasing it) or a negative effect (decreasing it)? How strong is this effect?","No, I don't think it would, I think it would take a while."
19,"Is the effect of Taxpayers' Burden on Support for universal healthcare immediate, or does it take time to develop? Does it have a positive effect (increasing it) or a negative effect (decreasing it)? How strong is this effect?",I think that would be more immediate. I think they would start taxing you before they ever started doing anything else.
20,"Is the effect of Access to Care on Support for universal healthcare immediate, or does it take time to develop? Does it have a positive effect (increasing it) or a negative effect (decreasing it)? How strong is this effect?","It takes time to develop, I mean you got to get people even in the mindset that they can go to the doctor when they need to and it's not going to be a life altering expense."
21,"Does Strong Effect have a positive or negative effect on Support for universal healthcare, and how significant is this effect? Does it have a positive effect (increasing it) or a negative effect (decreasing it)? How strong is this effect?",I think it's got a strong positive effect.
22,"What might lead to increases or decreases in Universal healthcare, and how significant are these effects? Please also indicate if these influences are positive (increasing) or negative (decreasing).","I think that, you know, if they come out and said it was going to cost everybody too much money, that would definitely lead to a significant decrease in support, or if they said that there was going to be limitations on the people that could be treated, that would lead to a significant decrease as well."
23,"Does Negative impact on universal healthcare have a positive or negative effect on Support for universal healthcare, and how significant is this effect? Does it have a positive effect (increasing it) or a negative effect (decreasing it)? How strong is this effect?","I'd say it's got a very negative impact, to have a negative impact."
24,How would you describe the relationship between Impact on healthcare access and Support for universal healthcare? Is it a strong or weak connection? Does it have a positive effect (increasing it) or a negative effect (decreasing it)? How strong is this effect?,"If you can get health care and you can afford it, then people are going to support it. But if the government starts making laws saying you can't get health care because they're in control of it and they own it, well then people aren't going to support it."
25,"Is the effect of Positive Effect on Support for Universal Healthcare on Support for universal healthcare immediate, or does it take time to develop? Does it have a positive effect (increasing it) or a negative effect (decreasing it)? How strong is this effect?","No, it wouldn't be immediate, it would take a while."
26,"What might lead to increases or decreases in Universal healthcare access, and how significant are these effects? Please also indicate if these influences are positive (increasing) or negative (decreasing).","If they put an age number like 65 and decreased access to universal health care and, you know, anybody over 65 can't get treatment and the government's not paying for it, that would significantly decrease it."
