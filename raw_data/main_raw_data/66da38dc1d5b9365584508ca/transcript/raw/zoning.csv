4,"You can switch between voice and text modes at any time. In voice mode, the microphone button will show as red when recording is active. During transcription, you'll see 'Transcribing your speech...' and your answer will be automatically submitted once ready. Feel comfortable with the system now?","Yes, let's get started."
5,"As the interview progresses, you'll notice the progress bar at the top of the screen showing your current position. Based on your responses, the system may generate follow-up questions to dive deeper into specific topics. These new questions will be added to your interview flow automatically. This helps us capture your thinking process more thoroughly.",Okay.
6,Excellent! We're now ready to begin the interview about urban zoning policies. Take your time with each response and provide as much detail as you'd like. Let's start with our first question.,Okay
7,To what extent do you support or oppose upzoning policies that allow for higher density housing in traditionally single-family neighborhoods? Please explain your reasoning.,I oppose upzoning to an extreme extent.
8,"What do you think are the most significant impacts, positive or negative, of increasing housing density in residential neighborhoods?","I think building larger buildings where people are viewing over the top of your property and invading your privacy and you have no way to block it, I think that's a problem."
9,How do you think upzoning policies might affect housing affordability in urban areas?,"I think it would cost so much to build the buildings, the price would just cost more and the rent would go up."
10,What impact do you believe increased housing density might have on neighborhood character and quality of life?,"I believe neighborhood density is going to play a role in theft, and crime, and safety for the children, and everything is going to diminish."
11,How do you think upzoning might affect transportation systems and traffic congestion in cities?,I think it would cause traffic to be too congested in the small streets of neighborhoods that weren't designed to have that kind of traffic.
12,What role do you believe local government should play in regulating housing development and density?,I believe there should be laws in place to protect privacy and other than that I don't know that there should be any laws governing what a neighborhood can do.
13,How might environmental concerns factor into decisions about urban density and zoning?,"If the neighborhoods wasn't designed for it, that means the sewer system probably wasn't designed for it, and all that waste from the oversized buildings and the added density is going to go somewhere, and it's probably going to be into the local water supply."
14,"What economic effects, both positive and negative, might result from changing zoning laws to allow more multi-family housing?","I think the economic effects of changing the zoning laws would be that there'd be more businesses opening up and there'd be more opportunity for small business, but at the same time there'd be more theft and crime, so you would be losing people that wanted to live there, so your good tenants would move out."
15,How do you think the interests of current residents versus future residents should be balanced when making zoning decisions?,I think current residents are already on the land and should have priority.
16,What role do you think social equity and access to opportunity play in discussions about zoning and housing policy?,I don't think it has any part.
17,How would you describe the relationship between Single-family neighborhoods and Support for Upzoning? Is it a strong or weak connection? Does it have a positive effect (increasing it) or a negative effect (decreasing it)? How strong is this effect?,I'd say it has a negative effect. I think the single-family homes are going to not be in that crowded environment.
18,What causes changes in Support for Upzoning? Are these influences strong or weak?,I don't think they have much influence at all over how the zoning's going to work out.
19,"Would small changes in Visual intrusion lead to noticeable changes in Support for Upzoning, or would it take larger shifts? Does it have a positive effect (increasing it) or a negative effect (decreasing it)? How strong is this effect?","If they could guarantee no invasion of privacy from somebody looking down on top of my property or somebody throwing trash out their windows onto my property, I wouldn't have a problem."
20,"Is the effect of Increased construction costs on Support for Upzoning immediate, or does it take time to develop? Does it have a positive effect (increasing it) or a negative effect (decreasing it)? How strong is this effect?","The increased construction costs would cause a problem until, you know, until it's finished, but I don't know how strong the effect would be."
21,How confident are you that changes in Crime lead to changes in Support for Upzoning? Does it have a positive effect (increasing it) or a negative effect (decreasing it)? How strong is this effect?,"I think changes in crime have a huge negative effect on how people support upvoting. They don't want the crime rate to go up, and it obviously will."
22,"Is the effect of Traffic Congestion on Support for Upzoning immediate, or does it take time to develop? Does it have a positive effect (increasing it) or a negative effect (decreasing it)? How strong is this effect?","That's another large negative effect of up-zoning, I mean the roads in the area are not designed for that amount of traffic."
23,"Is the effect of Sewer System Capacity on Support for Upzoning immediate, or does it take time to develop? Does it have a positive effect (increasing it) or a negative effect (decreasing it)? How strong is this effect?","I think the sewer system would never be upgraded until it gave out at a certain area, and then it would fix it. And when it gave out at the next area, it would fix it, and that's how they would go about that."
24,"Is the effect of Small business growth on Support for Upzoning immediate, or does it take time to develop? Does it have a positive effect (increasing it) or a negative effect (decreasing it)? How strong is this effect?","Small business would probably grow almost immediately, and that'd be a pretty good positive effect for the business owners, not for the people that own land in the area."
25,How confident are you that changes in Future residents' interests lead to changes in Support for Upzoning? Does it have a positive effect (increasing it) or a negative effect (decreasing it)? How strong is this effect?,"I think it makes a huge difference. I don't think they want to come in and upsize neighborhoods and have all the good tenants move out so that they can just get whoever move in, they'll just have a homeless neighborhood."
26,"What do you think are the main causes of Opposition to upzoning, and how certain are you about these relationships? Please also indicate if these influences are positive (increasing) or negative (decreasing).",I think the number one cause is probably crime rate and after that would probably be congestion and then privacy issues.
27,How would you describe the relationship between Privacy concerns and Support for Upzoning? Is it a strong or weak connection? Does it have a positive effect (increasing it) or a negative effect (decreasing it)? How strong is this effect?,"I think privacy issue is a very strong issue when it comes to upzoning because, as I've stated, you have no privacy when the people are taller than you and they're looking down on you."
28,"Would small changes in Negative effect lead to noticeable changes in Support for Upzoning, or would it take larger shifts? Does it have a positive effect (increasing it) or a negative effect (decreasing it)? How strong is this effect?","If they can fix the roads before they did the upzoning, that would help, or if they fix the sewers before they started the upzoning, that would help."
29,"Is the effect of Infrastructure Maintenance on Support for Upzoning immediate, or does it take time to develop? Does it have a positive effect (increasing it) or a negative effect (decreasing it)? How strong is this effect?",I think the infrastructure needs to go in before they start building an outzone. It needs to be ready to support it.
30,How confident are you that changes in Positive effect lead to changes in Support for Upzoning? Does it have a positive effect (increasing it) or a negative effect (decreasing it)? How strong is this effect?,I think that would be a very positive effect for upzone and if they upgrade the infrastructures then the neighborhood would appreciate it.
31,"What might lead to increases or decreases in Impact of increased housing density, and how significant are these effects? Please also indicate if these influences are positive (increasing) or negative (decreasing).","Full-time security in any, you know, place that has more than a certain number of people, that would help a lot."
32,How confident are you that changes in Lack of privacy lead to changes in Support for Upzoning? Does it have a positive effect (increasing it) or a negative effect (decreasing it)? How strong is this effect?,I'm very confident that changes in lack of privacy definitely lead to negative support for upZoning.
