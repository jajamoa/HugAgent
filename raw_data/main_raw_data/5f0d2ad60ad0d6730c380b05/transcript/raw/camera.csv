Question Number,Question,Answer
1,To what extent do you support or oppose the widespread deployment of surveillance cameras in public spaces? Please explain your reasoning.,I'm completely against it. It doesn't seem like a public space when you're being watched all the time. No freedom at all.
2,"What do you think are the most significant impacts, positive or negative, of increasing surveillance camera coverage in urban areas?","The only positive effect I can see is if it really does deter any crime, which I don't know if it will. The negative effect is that I don't want to be watched, and maybe people will even go out less, and stay away from where the cameras are, and it might even not help the crime because of that. They'll just avoid where the cameras are."
3,How do you think surveillance technologies might affect public safety and crime rates?,It probably won't even really help that much. The criminals will just find ways to work around it.
4,What impact do you believe increased surveillance might have on personal privacy and individual liberties?,"It destroys personal privacy and individual liberties. Like I said, people wouldn't even want to go out anymore. They'd feel like, you know, someone's watching all the time."
5,How do you think surveillance camera systems might affect community trust and police-community relations?,I think it would make people like the police even less. It's already not great. I already have no love for the police.
6,What role do you believe government should play in regulating surveillance technologies and data collection?,"I don't think they should do anything. You shouldn't put them up in the public places, and if I want to have my own camera that's fine, and they would have nothing to do with it. I can do what I want on my own property."
7,How might technological concerns about accuracy and reliability factor into decisions about surveillance systems?,"Well, you have to have a good enough quality camera, I guess, but other than that, I don't really know. Well, use of ""AI"" to identify the people in the video could certainly cause uproar."
8,"What economic effects, both positive and negative, might result from investing in widespread surveillance infrastructure?",The town may lose money as people want to go less and less in the areas where the cameras are.
9,How do you think the interests of law enforcement versus privacy advocates should be balanced when making surveillance policy?,The balance should be skewed way in favor of privacy advocates.
10,What role do you think social equity and potential bias play in discussions about surveillance technologies?,There could be bias against people like me who wear a mask all the time.
11,"Does Freedom have a positive or negative effect on Support for surveillance camera, and how significant is this effect? Does it have a positive effect (increasing it) or a negative effect (decreasing it)? How strong is this effect?",It has a very negative effect because having this surveillance destroys freedom.
12,"What factors do you think influence Support for surveillance camera, and how strong is their impact? Please also indicate if these influences are positive (increasing) or negative (decreasing).","Well, like I say, privacy and freedom concerns are strong factors against support for surveillance cameras, and I guess safety could be a small factor in support of them."
13,"Would small changes in Loss of Privacy lead to noticeable changes in Support for surveillance camera, or would it take larger shifts? Does it have a positive effect (increasing it) or a negative effect (decreasing it)? How strong is this effect?",I suppose a small change could make a big difference at this point since we already have big concerns about privacy and it already results in low support.
14,"Is the effect of Criminals adapting to technology on Support for surveillance camera immediate, or does it take time to develop? Does it have a positive effect (increasing it) or a negative effect (decreasing it)? How strong is this effect?","Well, I already gave this as a reason to not support it, but for others I think it'll come more slowly. The more they see it happening, the more they see the criminals adapting, the greater the support will drop off."
15,How would you describe the relationship between Personal Privacy and Support for surveillance camera? Is it a strong or weak connection? Does it have a positive effect (increasing it) or a negative effect (decreasing it)? How strong is this effect?,It's a very strong negatives connection.
16,"Would small changes in Negative perception of police lead to noticeable changes in Support for surveillance camera, or would it take larger shifts? Does it have a positive effect (increasing it) or a negative effect (decreasing it)? How strong is this effect?","When trust of the police is already so low, just a small change could result in a noticeable drop in the support."
17,"Does Surveillance technologies have a positive or negative effect on Support for surveillance camera, and how significant is this effect? Does it have a positive effect (increasing it) or a negative effect (decreasing it)? How strong is this effect?","I don't think the type of technology used would make a whole lot of difference unless, you know, like I say, it's so outdated and so terrible that it doesn't do any good to make the support even weigh less.  Well, actually people would be less supportive if AI is used to identify people I think."
18,How would you describe the relationship between Accuracy of surveillance systems and Support for surveillance camera? Is it a strong or weak connection? Does it have a positive effect (increasing it) or a negative effect (decreasing it)? How strong is this effect?,"Well you better believe it, if they're inaccurate, the support will drop way off."
19,How would you describe the relationship between Reduction in local business activity and Support for surveillance camera? Is it a strong or weak connection? Does it have a positive effect (increasing it) or a negative effect (decreasing it)? How strong is this effect?,"And of course, like I said, when business drops off, the support for the surveillance is going to drop way off as well."
20,"Does Surveillance Policy have a positive or negative effect on Support for surveillance camera, and how significant is this effect? Does it have a positive effect (increasing it) or a negative effect (decreasing it)? How strong is this effect?","Well, stuff like the getting rid of it after 48 hours that you mentioned might help some with support, but I still don't think it'll help a whole lot, whatever the policy is."
21,"Does Wearing a mask have a positive or negative effect on Support for surveillance camera, and how significant is this effect? Does it have a positive effect (increasing it) or a negative effect (decreasing it)? How strong is this effect?","Well, as someone who wears one all the time when going out in public, I already said that I think it, for me, makes me support it less, and I think it would for others as well."
22,"Does Negative effect have a positive or negative effect on Support for surveillance camera, and how significant is this effect? Does it have a positive effect (increasing it) or a negative effect (decreasing it)? How strong is this effect?","As we discussed, when people see negative effects, that support is going to drop way off."
23,"What factors do you think influence Surveillance cameras in public spaces, and how strong is their impact? Please also indicate if these influences are positive (increasing) or negative (decreasing).","Like I've been saying, I think the encroachment on privacy and freedom is the biggest factor and the smaller factor of safety, if there's any real improvement to that."
24,"Would small changes in Support for surveillance cameras lead to noticeable changes in Support for surveillance camera, or would it take larger shifts? Does it have a positive effect (increasing it) or a negative effect (decreasing it)? How strong is this effect?",The question makes no sense. A small change in support for surveillance cameras is a small change in support for surveillance cameras.
