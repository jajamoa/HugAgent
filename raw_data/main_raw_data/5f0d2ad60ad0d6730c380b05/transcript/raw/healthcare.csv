Question Number,Question,Answer
1,To what extent do you support or oppose universal healthcare policies that provide government-funded healthcare coverage for all citizens? Please explain your reasoning.,"I'm completely opposed to it. I have big health bills and I don't like having to pay them, but why should someone else be forced to?"
2,"What do you think are the most significant impacts, positive or negative, of implementing a universal healthcare system?","Well, I wouldn't have to worry about all these bills I have every month, but taxes would go way up for everyone, and care may go down, and it might take even longer to get in to see a doctor."
3,How do you think universal healthcare policies might affect healthcare quality and accessibility?,"Like I say, they would probably both go down, quality would get worse, and it would be harder to get in to see someone."
4,What impact do you believe a universal healthcare system might have on medical innovation and research?,There'd probably be less innovation research without competition to drive it.
5,How do you think universal healthcare might affect the economic burden on individuals and families?,"I think it would depend on the individual and family. Those who weren't making much use of these medical services will end up paying a lot more, and those who were using a lot may end up paying less."
6,What role do you believe government should play in healthcare delivery and financing?,I think the government should be completely out of it.
7,How might healthcare provider concerns factor into decisions about universal healthcare implementation?,Providers won't like all the additional red tape. They'll hate having to get the government's permission for whatever they do.
8,"What economic effects, both positive and negative, might result from transitioning to a universal healthcare system?","Well, like I say, those who use the system a lot or aren't paying any taxes may have some economic benefit. Then others would be paying way higher taxes, those who hardly use the system, especially."
9,How do you think the interests of taxpayers versus healthcare consumers should be balanced when making healthcare policy?,"Actually, I think keeping the government out of it serves both their interests to the greatest extent."
10,What role do you think social equity and access to care play in discussions about healthcare policy?,I don't think this plays any real role at all.
11,"Would small changes in Opposition to forced contributions lead to noticeable changes in Support for universal healthcare, or would it take larger shifts? Does it have a positive effect (increasing it) or a negative effect (decreasing it)? How strong is this effect?","No, there'd have to be some large changes. If people were forced to do it at all, they don't like it"
12,"What do you think are the main causes of Support for universal healthcare, and how certain are you about these relationships? Please also indicate if these influences are positive (increasing) or negative (decreasing).",I guess people support it because they think it's going to make more people have more access to healthcare and make it more affordable. Whether that's true or not is a different story.
13,How confident are you that changes in Reduced personal medical expenses lead to changes in Support for universal healthcare? Does it have a positive effect (increasing it) or a negative effect (decreasing it)? How strong is this effect?,"Well, that would help a lot of people for sure, but I already said how it won't for me. I have huge medical expenses right now, but, you know, I want to be able to pay for  them myself like I have been."
14,How would you describe the relationship between Healthcare quality and Support for universal healthcare? Is it a strong or weak connection? Does it have a positive effect (increasing it) or a negative effect (decreasing it)? How strong is this effect?,"Well, if people could be convinced that the quality would not go down, that would increase the support quite a bit, I think, but I don't know how they would be able to do this."
15,How would you describe the relationship between Medical innovation and Support for universal healthcare? Is it a strong or weak connection? Does it have a positive effect (increasing it) or a negative effect (decreasing it)? How strong is this effect?,"When people see medical innovation decreasing in places where there is universal health care, that would make a huge decrease in support."
16,"Would small changes in Economic impact on individuals lead to noticeable changes in Support for universal healthcare, or would it take larger shifts? Does it have a positive effect (increasing it) or a negative effect (decreasing it)? How strong is this effect?","No, there needs to be large changes, the medical costs are so darn high, that you need to have a big change for someone to change their support. The cost shouldn't be that high; the government being involved is part of what makes it so high."
17,How would you describe the relationship between Free market in healthcare and Support for universal healthcare? Is it a strong or weak connection? Does it have a positive effect (increasing it) or a negative effect (decreasing it)? How strong is this effect?,"Well, people that support the free market like me are more opposed to  universal health care. It's the opposite, you know. If there was some real competition, maybe prices would be way lower like they should be."
18,How would you describe the relationship between Provider dissatisfaction and Support for universal healthcare? Is it a strong or weak connection? Does it have a positive effect (increasing it) or a negative effect (decreasing it)? How strong is this effect?,"If people are dissatisfied with their providers, they might be more inclined to support universal healthcare. They might also be unpleasantly surprised when it only gets worse."
19,"Does Higher taxes for infrequent users have a positive or negative effect on Support for universal healthcare, and how significant is this effect? Does it have a positive effect (increasing it) or a negative effect (decreasing it)? How strong is this effect?","Well, people that don't use the system paying higher taxes are certainly going to have a huge negative effect on support."
20,"Is the effect of Taxpayers' interests on Support for universal healthcare immediate, or does it take time to develop? Does it have a positive effect (increasing it) or a negative effect (decreasing it)? How strong is this effect?",The effect would be immediate. Taxes would have to go up right away. People would not like it right away.
21,What causes changes in Universal healthcare? Are these influences strong or weak?,"If you mean changes in support for it, well, if someone's situation changes, it might change their stance on it. It shouldn't, but it might, you know, if someone didn't have any medical issues, and then they do, and vice versa."
22,How would you describe the relationship between Increased access to healthcare and Support for universal healthcare? Is it a strong or weak connection? Does it have a positive effect (increasing it) or a negative effect (decreasing it)? How strong is this effect?,"Well, if it really increased access to healthcare that would certainly garner a lot more support for it, but I think the opposite would happen. It'd be harder to get in anywhere."
23,"Is the effect of Personal financial responsibility on Support for universal healthcare immediate, or does it take time to develop? Does it have a positive effect (increasing it) or a negative effect (decreasing it)? How strong is this effect?","It would be immediate, any change in what people have to pay for things takes effect right away, in a large way."
24,How would you describe the relationship between Impact on support for universal healthcare and Support for universal healthcare? Is it a strong or weak connection? Does it have a positive effect (increasing it) or a negative effect (decreasing it)? How strong is this effect?,"I'm not exactly sure what you mean here, but if you mean effects of it, I mean  if it has good effects it certainly will drive the support up, and if there's bad effects it will drive it way down and quickly"
25,"Is the effect of Opposition to universal healthcare on Support for universal healthcare immediate, or does it take time to develop? Does it have a positive effect (increasing it) or a negative effect (decreasing it)? How strong is this effect?","Well, some people might hear opposing arguments and lower their support right away, and others might gradually  over time, and some might just get stronger in their support."
26,How confident are you that changes in Negative effect on support lead to changes in Support for universal healthcare? Does it have a positive effect (increasing it) or a negative effect (decreasing it)? How strong is this effect?,I am very confident if there's negative effects that support will drop off quickly.
