2,"What do you think are the most significant impacts, positive or negative, of implementing a universal healthcare system?","A major positive impact is improved public health, as more people receive preventative and consistent care. On the downside, it could strain government budgets and potentially lead to longer wait times for non-urgent procedures."

However, there’s a risk that quality could vary if demand increases faster than the system can handle."

Their input is crucial to design policies that maintain care quality and prevent burnout.
8,"What economic effects, both positive and negative, might result from transitioning to a universal healthcare system?","Positively, universal healthcare could lower overall healthcare costs through streamlined administration and preventive care.
