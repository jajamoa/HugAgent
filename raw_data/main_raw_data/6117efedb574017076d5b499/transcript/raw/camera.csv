Question Number,Question,Answer
1,To what extent do you support or oppose the widespread deployment of surveillance cameras in public spaces? Please explain your reasoning.,"I somewhat support using surveillance cameras because they can help reduce crime and improve safety. But I’m also cautious about privacy and potential misuse, so there should be clear rules and oversight."
2,"What do you think are the most significant impacts, positive or negative, of increasing surveillance camera coverage in urban areas?","More cameras can help reduce crime and make people feel safer, but they also raise privacy concerns and may lead to misuse or over-surveillance."
3,How do you think surveillance technologies might affect public safety and crime rates?,"Surveillance tech can lower crime by deterring offenders and helping catch criminals faster, but it’s not a complete solution and can sometimes miss context."
4,What impact do you believe increased surveillance might have on personal privacy and individual liberties?,"More surveillance risks invading personal privacy and making people feel watched, which can limit freedom and trust in public spaces."
5,How do you think surveillance camera systems might affect community trust and police-community relations?,Surveillance can both build trust by improving safety and hurt it if people feel unfairly targeted or watched too closely by police. Balancing use and transparency is key.
6,What role do you believe government should play in regulating surveillance technologies and data collection?,The government should set clear rules to protect privacy while ensuring cameras help keep people safe. Oversight and transparency are essential to avoid misuse.
7,How might technological concerns about accuracy and reliability factor into decisions about surveillance systems?,Concerns about accuracy are important because faulty tech can lead to false accusations. Reliable systems build trust and reduce mistakes in surveillance.
8,"What economic effects, both positive and negative, might result from investing in widespread surveillance infrastructure?",Investing in surveillance can boost local jobs and security but might also increase costs for taxpayers. Overuse could hurt business if people feel watched or unsafe.
9,How do you think the interests of law enforcement versus privacy advocates should be balanced when making surveillance policy?,Policies should protect privacy while giving law enforcement tools to keep people safe. It’s about finding fair limits and clear oversight.
10,What role do you think social equity and potential bias play in discussions about surveillance technologies?,Social equity is key because surveillance can unfairly target marginalized groups. Addressing bias ensures systems don’t deepen inequalities.
