6,Excellent! We're now ready to begin the interview about urban zoning policies. Take your time with each response and provide as much detail as you'd like. Let's start with our first question.,Go ahead.
7,To what extent do you support or oppose upzoning policies that allow for higher density housing in traditionally single-family neighborhoods? Please explain your reasoning.,"I support it, because we have a massive housing crisis.  Building up is more efficient and environmentally friendly as well.  Also the neighborhoods will be more walkable."
8,"What do you think are the most significant impacts, positive or negative, of increasing housing density in residential neighborhoods?","The housing crisis will ease, rents will be more affordable, houses will be more affordable, more families will form, neighborhoods will be more walkable, there will be less car traffic and pollution.  The bad effects are that there could be more noise and arguments and disagreements with neighbors on top of each other.  It could change the character of the neighborhood."
9,How do you think upzoning policies might affect housing affordability in urban areas?,"It is supply and demand.  If you increase supply anywhere, the demand will drop so houses will be more affordable in urban areas."
10,What impact do you believe increased housing density might have on neighborhood character and quality of life?,"It could go both ways. It could be good in that higher density means more walkable neighborhoods.  There will be less car noise and pollution.  People could talk and mingle more with neighbors.  Families could move in and kids could play.  If ""bad people"" move in you could get more crime.  There could also be more neighbor disagreements since they will be closer together."
11,How do you think upzoning might affect transportation systems and traffic congestion in cities?,"I think it will decrease traffic congestion.  If you upzone you can get taller buildings which will make things closer together and sometimes all in the same building so you don't need a car.  If you get high enough density, you could get public transit."
12,What role do you believe local government should play in regulating housing development and density?,"I would say keep the regulations as light as possible while trying not to affect neighbors.  In other words, don't build a tall building right next to someone's house that blocks the view and the sun.  However, if it is on a big lot, then yeah go ahead and let them build.  Also, get rid of parking minimums.  Let the developers decide for themselves how much of that to build."
13,How might environmental concerns factor into decisions about urban density and zoning?,"If it is already urban, then the biggest benefit for the environment is to build higher.  You gain efficiencies in heating and cooling by having a bunch of apartments together.  If you can get some small businesses nearby, you could eliminate the need for cars and go with public transport or even encourage biking."
14,"What economic effects, both positive and negative, might result from changing zoning laws to allow more multi-family housing?","Increased GDP would be one.  People would be able to buy a house, settle into the community and start a family.  You would get a higher tax base and lots of economic construction revenue."
15,How do you think the interests of current residents versus future residents should be balanced when making zoning decisions?,"That is the issue right now.  Current residents don't want their neighborhoods changed.  They want it to stay the way it is when they bought it.  Also, by not allowing development, they restrict supply of housing, which drives up housing prices, which increases their net worth.  These people vote too so odds are stacked against future residents."
16,What role do you think social equity and access to opportunity play in discussions about zoning and housing policy?,The people on the bottom of everything get the short end and that is what is going on here so you might be able to convince liberals to change their zoning laws as most zoning is local and liberals dominate the big cities.
17,"What factors do you think influence Housing crisis, and how strong is their impact? Please also indicate if these influences are positive (increasing) or negative (decreasing).","Zoning laws - minimum lots sizes, minimum house sizes, can't go off the grid, can't do your own housework, need a permit for everything - These influences are negative for housing as they decrease supply."
18,How would you describe the relationship between Housing crisis and Support for Upzoning? Is it a strong or weak connection? Is it a positive influence (increases) or negative influence (decreases)? How strong is this effect?,"I think it is a strong positive influence in that people are beginning to see the negative effects of this.  There is a decreased birth rate due to this and also homeowners tend to be more stable and reliable.  If there wasn't a housing crisis, people wouldn't care."
19,How would you describe the relationship between Walkability and Support for Upzoning? Is it a strong or weak connection? Does it have a positive effect (increasing it) or a negative effect (decreasing it)? How strong is this effect?,"I think there is a strong positive connection.  Liberals tend to value city life and want to walk places or use public transport.  If you have a walkable city, you strongly reduce climate change which they care about."
20,How confident are you that changes in Affordable Housing lead to changes in Support for Upzoning? Does it have a positive effect (increasing it) or a negative effect (decreasing it)? How strong is this effect?,Define what you mean by changes in affordable housing.
21,"Would small changes in Supply and Demand lead to noticeable changes in Support for Upzoning, or would it take larger shifts? Does it have a positive effect (increasing it) or a negative effect (decreasing it)? How strong is this effect?",It would take larger shifts.  People only started caring when young people couldn't live on their own and couldn't afford families.  That is when people only really started caring.
22,How would you describe the relationship between Taller buildings and Support for Upzoning? Is it a strong or weak connection? Does it have a positive effect (increasing it) or a negative effect (decreasing it)? How strong is this effect?,Are you talking about people who live near tall buildings vs. rural areas?
23,How confident are you that changes in Big lots allowance lead to changes in Support for Upzoning? Does it have a positive effect (increasing it) or a negative effect (decreasing it)? How strong is this effect?,What do you mean by big lots allowance?
24,"Is the effect of Heating and cooling efficiencies on Support for Upzoning immediate, or does it take time to develop? Does it have a positive effect (increasing it) or a negative effect (decreasing it)? How strong is this effect?",I don't think there is an effect.  I think it is just a benefit that people don't realize.
25,How would you describe the relationship between Higher tax base and Support for Upzoning? Is it a strong or weak connection? Does it have a positive effect (increasing it) or a negative effect (decreasing it)? How strong is this effect?,A higher tax base is associated with a strong negative effect on Upzoning.  Usually these are rich people or professionals who have manicured houses which are expensive and are an investment.  They want zoning strict so they can grow the value of their investment (house).
26,"Is the effect of Neighborhood stability on Support for Upzoning immediate, or does it take time to develop? Does it have a positive effect (increasing it) or a negative effect (decreasing it)? How strong is this effect?",Neighborhood stability has a strong negative effect on support for upzoning.  A stable neighborhood doesn't want anything to change.  Change threatens the social order and the way things are.
27,"Does People on the Bottom have a positive or negative effect on Support for Upzoning, and how significant is this effect? Does it have a positive effect (increasing it) or a negative effect (decreasing it)? How strong is this effect?",People on the bottom have a strong positive effect on support for upzoning because these are the people who can't afford to buy a house.  They are renters or living with their parents.  They are being shut out of the American Dream and are angry about it.
28,How would you describe the relationship between Decrease in housing supply and Support for Upzoning? Is it a strong or weak connection? Does it have a positive effect (increasing it) or a negative effect (decreasing it)? How strong is this effect?,"It is a strong positive effect because this is the situation we are in now. We are only talking about zoning changes because we have a severe housing shortage.  Before that, no one cared or was taking about it."
29,"Is the effect of Public transport on Support for Upzoning immediate, or does it take time to develop? Does it have a positive effect (increasing it) or a negative effect (decreasing it)? How strong is this effect?",I would say there is a weak positive effect since people using public transportation tend to be poorer and they are being shut out of the American Dream of owning a home.
30,"Is the effect of Liberals on Support for Upzoning immediate, or does it take time to develop? Does it have a positive effect (increasing it) or a negative effect (decreasing it)? How strong is this effect?",I think it is a weak positive effect.  Liberals are beginning to see the effect of zoning on poor people which they care about.
31,How confident are you that changes in Definition of changes in affordable housing lead to changes in Support for Upzoning? Does it have a positive effect (increasing it) or a negative effect (decreasing it)? How strong is this effect?,"I think it is a weak positive effect in support of upzoning, because beforehand when you talked about affordable housing, people though Section 8 vouchers which made people uncomfortable."
