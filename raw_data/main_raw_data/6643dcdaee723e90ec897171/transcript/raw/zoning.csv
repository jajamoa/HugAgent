6,Excellent! We're now ready to begin the interview about urban zoning policies. Take your time with each response and provide as much detail as you'd like. Let's start with our first question.,Okay.
7,To what extent do you support or oppose upzoning policies that allow for higher density housing in traditionally single-family neighborhoods? Please explain your reasoning.,I don't feel like they should have higher density housing mixed in with traditional single family neighborhoods. I don't see how mixing the two is good when people are paying a lot of money to live in their own separate houses.
8,"What do you think are the most significant impacts, positive or negative, of increasing housing density in residential neighborhoods?","The most significant impact would be negative and that would be too many people in a small area. It causes traffic jams, it causes people to be late for work, it causes more car accidents, more crime. You just can't put a lot of people into a small area."
9,How do you think upzoning policies might affect housing affordability in urban areas?,"It would probably eventually make housing more affordable, but in the area we're in right now, they're still charging ridiculous amounts to pack people in because of greed."
10,What impact do you believe increased housing density might have on neighborhood character and quality of life?,I think the quality of life would go down because nobody's happy being stuffed like sardines into neighborhoods. People are happier when they have places to exercise and stretch their legs and have privacy. I think the character of the neighborhoods might look trashy due to they're so full of people.
11,How do you think upzoning might affect transportation systems and traffic congestion in cities?,"If the cities don't plan ahead and there's not enough ways for people to get in and out of the city, like say only one highway, then there's going to be congestion and transportation is always behind so they won't have anything for the people to use, such as buses or trains. If they could plan that ahead of time, it wouldn't cause a problem."
12,What role do you believe local government should play in regulating housing development and density?,Local government should definitely step in and make sure that housing development is done properly and safely and up to code and they should also look at the infrastructure of the area to see if it can hold that many people and stop it until it can.
13,How might environmental concerns factor into decisions about urban density and zoning?,Waste water would be a huge one. All the extra trash and recycling too
14,"What economic effects, both positive and negative, might result from changing zoning laws to allow more multi-family housing?",The economic effects might be better because there's more people purchasing more things from the stores and the food in the area.
15,How do you think the interests of current residents versus future residents should be balanced when making zoning decisions?,I think the interest of the current residents should be looked at instead of future residents. Future residents are not choosing to live there already.
16,What role do you think social equity and access to opportunity play in discussions about zoning and housing policy?,I'm not sure of this question
17,"Is the effect of Single-family neighborhoods on Support for Upzoning immediate, or does it take time to develop? Does it have a positive effect (increasing it) or a negative effect (decreasing it)? How strong is this effect?",It takes time to develop. It has a positive effect eventually.
18,"What factors affect Support for Upzoning, and which ones have the strongest influence? Please also indicate if these influences are positive (increasing) or negative (decreasing).",Negative influences would be greed and people wanting to make more money by making housing and not caring about the effects it will have on the people that live there.
19,How would you describe the relationship between Negative Impacts and Support for Upzoning? Is it a strong or weak connection? Does it have a positive effect (increasing it) or a negative effect (decreasing it)? How strong is this effect?,"I don't think there's a relationship between negative impacts and support for upzoning. The people who support it, well I'm not sure what they want other than affordable housing which would be great, but I'm afraid that's not what they're getting from this."
20,"Is the effect of Traffic Jams on Support for Upzoning immediate, or does it take time to develop? Does it have a positive effect (increasing it) or a negative effect (decreasing it)? How strong is this effect?",I feel like this question doesn't make any sense. How can the effect of traffic jams cause for support of upzoning?
21,"Does Housing affordability have a positive or negative effect on Support for Upzoning, and how significant is this effect? Does it have a positive effect (increasing it) or a negative effect (decreasing it)? How strong is this effect?",Housing affordability is a definite positive side on upzoning. It's just about the only positive effect.
22,"Does Privacy concerns have a positive or negative effect on Support for Upzoning, and how significant is this effect? Does it have a positive effect (increasing it) or a negative effect (decreasing it)? How strong is this effect?",Privacy concerns have a very negative effect on up-zoning. People want to live their lives privately and they cannot do that.
23,"Does Transportation Systems have a positive or negative effect on Support for Upzoning, and how significant is this effect? Does it have a positive effect (increasing it) or a negative effect (decreasing it)? How strong is this effect?","If there are transportation systems put into effect with the upzoning, that would be very positive and very strong for the environment."
24,How confident are you that changes in Traffic Congestion lead to changes in Support for Upzoning? Does it have a positive effect (increasing it) or a negative effect (decreasing it)? How strong is this effect?,"If traffic congestion could be fixed in upzoning, it would be positive. However, because of the negative sides of too many people with too many cars, it would definitely be a deal breaker for upzoning."
25,"Is the effect of Proper and safe housing development on Support for Upzoning immediate, or does it take time to develop? Does it have a positive effect (increasing it) or a negative effect (decreasing it)? How strong is this effect?","Proper and safe housing development is very important for upzoning. It would need to be watched carefully and to code to make sure that if they were going to bring all those people in, it would be in a safe manner."
26,"Would small changes in Urban density lead to noticeable changes in Support for Upzoning, or would it take larger shifts? Does it have a positive effect (increasing it) or a negative effect (decreasing it)? How strong is this effect?",Small changes in urban density would definitely lead to noticeable changes. It would have maybe a positive effect in the beginning and then lead to a negative effect from overcrowding.
27,"Is the effect of Consumer spending on Support for Upzoning immediate, or does it take time to develop? Does it have a positive effect (increasing it) or a negative effect (decreasing it)? How strong is this effect?",The effect of consumer spending would be immediate and it would be positive.
28,How confident are you that changes in Current residents' interests lead to changes in Support for Upzoning? Does it have a positive effect (increasing it) or a negative effect (decreasing it)? How strong is this effect?,I am not confident at all that changes in the current residents' interests would lead to changes in support.
29,How confident are you that changes in Positive Effect lead to changes in Support for Upzoning? Does it have a positive effect (increasing it) or a negative effect (decreasing it)? How strong is this effect?,"Yes, changes in positive effect would lead to changes in support for upzoning, it would be positive effect."
30,"Is the effect of People prioritizing profit over community impact on Support for Upzoning immediate, or does it take time to develop? Does it have a positive effect (increasing it) or a negative effect (decreasing it)? How strong is this effect?","The effect of people prioritizing profit over community would be very, very negative. It would be immediate."
31,What causes changes in Opposition to upzoning? Are these influences strong or weak?,"Changes in opposition could be anything from deals made to the community in return for giving up their privacy and properties, or I don't know."
