Question Number,Question,Answer
1,To what extent do you support or oppose universal healthcare policies that provide government-funded healthcare coverage for all citizens? Please explain your reasoning.,"I definitely support it because I do believe that it helps out a lot more people than it seems to be, and I do believe that it makes it more affordable."
2,"What do you think are the most significant impacts, positive or negative, of implementing a universal healthcare system?",So the impacts positive would definitely be that there would be more people to help and to have access to health care for. The negative impacts would definitely be the money aspect.
3,How do you think universal healthcare policies might affect healthcare quality and accessibility?,I think that the policies would definitely make the quality and accessibility probably harder just for the fact that it might cost a lot more money.
4,What impact do you believe a universal healthcare system might have on medical innovation and research?,"I think the impact would be pretty positive and pretty negative. I do believe that a lot of people do struggle with pain with the healthcare system, and I do believe that the positive effect would just be to bring more of that healthcare system into more communities."
5,How do you think universal healthcare might affect the economic burden on individuals and families?,I do believe that again the effect would be the money aspect just for the fact that a lot of people can't afford the health care and like it makes a lot of people more in debt and I do believe that that's a pretty big burden.
6,What role do you believe government should play in healthcare delivery and financing?,"I do believe that the government should make it way more affordable and to help a lot more people out because if the government can make it more affordable, then more families can have more healthcare and more families could help out their own people and stuff like that and so on."
7,How might healthcare provider concerns factor into decisions about universal healthcare implementation?,The concerns would be that the healthcare provider themselves would not be bringing in the revenue that they think because the prices would be decreased so they'd make less money on people.
8,"What economic effects, both positive and negative, might result from transitioning to a universal healthcare system?",So the positive effects would definitely be that it be more affordable and more families and communities can afford it a lot better and not be in debt. I do believe that the negative effects would be specifically for the health care providers themselves because they lose more money and not make a lot of profit or revenue.
9,How do you think the interests of taxpayers versus healthcare consumers should be balanced when making healthcare policy?,I do believe that taxpayers when they do pay for their health care they should have access to any sort of health care that they do need for them or their families and I do believe that the consumers should also follow the same boat as the taxpayers. I do believe that it can be a lot more balanced though with the pricing of these health care facilities being less money than it already is.
10,What role do you think social equity and access to care play in discussions about healthcare policy?,"I do believe that the role of this plays out in a bigger picture. I do believe that, like a lot of people and families think that they're being racially divided because of this, because I do believe that there are certain providers that charge more people, specifically certain, like certain races and stuff like that. So I do believe that that's a pretty big role."
11,How confident are you that changes in Helping more people lead to changes in Support for universal healthcare? Does it have a positive effect (increasing it) or a negative effect (decreasing it)?

And I do believe that when they don't make as much revenue as they think, well then that's why that the prices rise up. And I do believe that that's a very negative influence on this community. And just for the fact that healthcare providers don't seem to care as much about you as you think."
13,How confident are you that changes in Financial implications lead to changes in Support for universal healthcare? Does it have a positive effect (increasing it) or a negative effect (decreasing it)? How strong is this effect?,"So, I do believe that the financial implications can lead to a lot of negative impacts because I do believe again that they go after the profit and what they're making off certain people and families and I do believe that that's a very strong effect but it's a very negative effect because I do believe again that these healthcare policies are mainly structured around money."
14,"Does Cost concerns have a positive or negative effect on Support for universal healthcare, and how significant is this effect?

18,"Would small changes in Revenue impact on healthcare providers lead to noticeable changes in Support for universal healthcare, or would it take larger shifts?

I do believe it's a strong effect.

Does it have a positive effect (increasing it) or a negative effect (decreasing it)?
