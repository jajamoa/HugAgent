6,Excellent! We're now ready to begin the interview about urban zoning policies. Take your time with each response and provide as much detail as you'd like. Let's start with our first question.,Great
7,To what extent do you support or oppose upzoning policies that allow for higher density housing in traditionally single-family neighborhoods? Please explain your reasoning.,"I support upzoning policies in many areas because more people need affordable places to live, especially in this economy. So I do support upzoning policies for single-family neighborhoods because those are typically the people that need housing."
8,"What do you think are the most significant impacts, positive or negative, of increasing housing density in residential neighborhoods?",I think the most positive impact is more affordable housing for more people. So more accessibility overall. I think the negative impact is overcrowding and having the overall environment altered. The views will change if a lot of skyscraper apartment complexes are built which is concerning. I love nature and love to feel connected to the environment and this might disrupt that connection.
9,How do you think upzoning policies might affect housing affordability in urban areas?,I think it will greatly decrease the prices and maybe value of the housing in urban areas
10,What impact do you believe increased housing density might have on neighborhood character and quality of life?,"I think it may slighbtly lower quality of life if it removes the connection to nature. However if the sense of nature is preserved then I beluiebe the quality of life will improve for people. Cheaper rent, more shops being available and closer is good."
11,How do you think upzoning might affect transportation systems and traffic congestion in cities?,It will most likely increase traffic congestion for the general population. Unless there is more accessible and cheap public transportation. Then I think more people will take advantage of public transportation and traffic wont be changed.
12,What role do you believe local government should play in regulating housing development and density?,I believe that the local government should make sure there is enough accessible and affordable housing for the people that live there.
13,How might environmental concerns factor into decisions about urban density and zoning?,I think people who like to feel a sense of connection with nature will be against large buildings being built.
14,"What economic effects, both positive and negative, might result from changing zoning laws to allow more multi-family housing?",I think it will have a positive impact on the economy because there will be more affordable housing. There will also be new shops build which will provide employment for some of the new people.
15,How do you think the interests of current residents versus future residents should be balanced when making zoning decisions?,I think current residents should have some say on what is going on in the community.
16,What role do you think social equity and access to opportunity play in discussions about zoning and housing policy?,I think increased social equity and decreased access will have a positive effect on zoning and housing discussions. 
17,How would you describe the relationship between Upzoning policies and Support for Upzoning? Is it a strong or weak connection? Does it have a positive effect (increasing it) or a negative effect (decreasing it)? How strong is this effect?,I think it has a positive effect because people want to have more affordable housing.
18,"Would small changes in Affordable housing lead to noticeable changes in Support for Upzoning, or would it take larger shifts? Does it have a positive effect (increasing it) or a negative effect (decreasing it)? How strong is this effect?",I think so I think more people would support it as they see the changes happen.
19,How would you describe the relationship between Accessibility and Support for Upzoning? Is it a strong or weak connection? Does it have a positive effect (increasing it) or a negative effect (decreasing it)? How strong is this effect?,I think less acessibility will increase support for upzoning.

21,"Is the effect of Decrease in housing prices on Support for Upzoning immediate, or does it take time to develop? Does it have a positive effect (increasing it) or a negative effect (decreasing it)? How strong is this effect?",I think it takes time to develop as people realize the change.
