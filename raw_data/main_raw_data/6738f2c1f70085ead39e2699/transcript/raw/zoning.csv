6,Excellent! We're now ready to begin the interview about urban zoning policies. Take your time with each response and provide as much detail as you'd like. Let's start with our first question.,Okay
7,To what extent do you support or oppose upzoning policies that allow for higher density housing in traditionally single-family neighborhoods? Please explain your reasoning.,I support as long as the people who live in those single-family neighborhoods support it.
8,"What do you think are the most significant impacts, positive or negative, of increasing housing density in residential neighborhoods?","Well, it increases the affordability of housing by increasing the supply. Negative impact could be that it drives down home values."
9,How do you think upzoning policies might affect housing affordability in urban areas?,"Well, like I said, if you increase the supply of houses, the price goes down. Simple market dynamics."
10,What impact do you believe increased housing density might have on neighborhood character and quality of life?,I guess it could change it if the people who move shared nothing in common with the people who already live there.
11,How do you think upzoning might affect transportation systems and traffic congestion in cities?,It might increase traffic congestion of streets are replaced by buildings and the city or town do not increase public transportation.
12,What role do you believe local government should play in regulating housing development and density?,It should increase housing development if there is a scarcity of housing but also with consideration to the effects of higher density.
13,How might environmental concerns factor into decisions about urban density and zoning?,The developer/city must ensure there are enough green areas for the new housing.
14,"What economic effects, both positive and negative, might result from changing zoning laws to allow more multi-family housing?",It will lower the cost of housing but also lower the property value of existing homes.
15,How do you think the interests of current residents versus future residents should be balanced when making zoning decisions?,"If the scarcity of housing is severe, I think the interests of future resident should be prioritized. And if the scarcity is not as severe, the interests of current residents might weigh heavier."
16,What role do you think social equity and access to opportunity play in discussions about zoning and housing policy?,Government must ensure all groups within society have equal access to affordable housing.
17,"Does Community consent have a positive or negative effect on Support for Upzoning, and how significant is this effect? Does it have a positive effect (increasing it) or a negative effect (decreasing it)? How strong is this effect?","Yes, it has a huge impact because zoning laws give great power to existing home owners."
18,"What factors affect Support for Upzoning, and which ones have the strongest influence? Please also indicate if these influences are positive (increasing) or negative (decreasing).","The need for increased housing units and the Community consent to allow for upzoning, and without a doubt, Community consent has the biggest influence. That influence can be positive or negative depending on the particular circumstances."
19,How confident are you that changes in Affordability lead to changes in Support for Upzoning? Does it have a positive effect (increasing it) or a negative effect (decreasing it)? How strong is this effect?,I don't think it will have any effect because the biggest influence is the Community consent.
20,How confident are you that changes in Supply and demand lead to changes in Support for Upzoning? Does it have a positive effect (increasing it) or a negative effect (decreasing it)? How strong is this effect?,"Well, it increase support for upzoning if the increased supply does not negatively affect houses' values."
21,How would you describe the relationship between Neighborhood character and Support for Upzoning? Is it a strong or weak connection? Does it have a positive effect (increasing it) or a negative effect (decreasing it)? How strong is this effect?,"I don't think it's either strong or weak, but can be used an as excuse to obstruct upzoning."
22,How confident are you that changes in Traffic Congestion lead to changes in Support for Upzoning? Does it have a positive effect (increasing it) or a negative effect (decreasing it)? How strong is this effect?,"It will not lead to increase support or opposition, unless it decreases properties values significantly."
23,"Does Local government role have a positive or negative effect on Support for Upzoning, and how significant is this effect? Does it have a positive effect (increasing it) or a negative effect (decreasing it)? How strong is this effect?",It has no effect because the decision ultimately rests with the existing homeowners.
24,"Does Housing development have a positive or negative effect on Support for Upzoning, and how significant is this effect? Does it have a positive effect (increasing it) or a negative effect (decreasing it)? How strong is this effect?",I don't know what you mean.
25,"Is the effect of Green areas on Support for Upzoning immediate, or does it take time to develop? Does it have a positive effect (increasing it) or a negative effect (decreasing it)? How strong is this effect?",It can have an effect depending on the importance that the different players give it.
26,How would you describe the relationship between Decrease in property values and Support for Upzoning? Is it a strong or weak connection? Does it have a positive effect (increasing it) or a negative effect (decreasing it)? How strong is this effect?,It's directly correlated. Decrease in property values leads to increase opposition for Upzoning and the connections is strong.
27,"Is the effect of Interests of future residents on Support for Upzoning immediate, or does it take time to develop? Does it have a positive effect (increasing it) or a negative effect (decreasing it)? How strong is this effect?","It has relative little effect, and when it does, the effect is weak."
28,"Is the effect of Access to Opportunity on Support for Upzoning immediate, or does it take time to develop? Does it have a positive effect (increasing it) or a negative effect (decreasing it)? How strong is this effect?","Well, it increases support Upzoning among those who believe in it. It can have positive or negative effect depending on the circumstances. But it's effect is ultimately weak."
29,"What factors do you think influence Increased housing supply, and how strong is their impact? Please also indicate if these influences are positive (increasing) or negative (decreasing).","Weak zoning laws is the biggest factor that increases housing supply because it leaves the biggest obstacle for upzoning, homeowners, weakened."

How strong is this effect?,"It might not lead to increased support for upzoning, but it will lead to the construction of upzoning."
