Question Number,Question,Answer
1,To what extent do you support or oppose the widespread deployment of surveillance cameras in public spaces? Please explain your reasoning.,I'm neutral.
2,"What do you think are the most significant impacts, positive or negative, of increasing surveillance camera coverage in urban areas?",It can be used to deter crime but it can also be abused by the government to control people's behaviors.
3,How do you think surveillance technologies might affect public safety and crime rates?,It might deter people from committing crimes if they know they're being watched.
4,What impact do you believe increased surveillance might have on personal privacy and individual liberties?,It can have negative impact on personal privacy and individual liberties if the recordings are used inappropriately.
5,How do you think surveillance camera systems might affect community trust and police-community relations?,It might increase the trust if there's a high crime rate in that area.
6,What role do you believe government should play in regulating surveillance technologies and data collection?,It should play a big role to make sure surveillance technologies don't do things the person using it did not consent to and that the data collected is not misused.
7,How might technological concerns about accuracy and reliability factor into decisions about surveillance systems?,It might increase opposition to it if the technology cannot be relied upon.
8,"What economic effects, both positive and negative, might result from investing in widespread surveillance infrastructure?",I can't think of economic effects.
9,How do you think the interests of law enforcement versus privacy advocates should be balanced when making surveillance policy?,I think the concerns of both groups should be considered when implementing surveillance technology.
10,What role do you think social equity and potential bias play in discussions about surveillance technologies?,I think it should be play in role to ensure all groups are treated the same under the surveillance technologies and that there is no bias in its implementation.
11,"What do you think are the main causes of Support for surveillance camera, and how certain are you about these relationships? Please also indicate if these influences are positive (increasing) or negative (decreasing).",I think the main cause of support for surveillance technology is concern for safety and it has a great deal of influence.
12,"Does Crime deterrence have a positive or negative effect on Support for surveillance camera, and how significant is this effect? Does it have a positive effect (increasing it) or a negative effect (decreasing it)? How strong is this effect?","Crime deterrence has a big effect, and whether the effect is positive or negative depends on how you see it."
13,"Is the effect of Deterrence on Support for surveillance camera immediate, or does it take time to develop? Does it have a positive effect (increasing it) or a negative effect (decreasing it)? How strong is this effect?","I think it can be both immediate or take time to develop depending on whether crime is high or not in that area. Again, the positive or negative effect depends on how you see it, but its effect is strong."
14,"Does Personal privacy have a positive or negative effect on Support for surveillance camera, and how significant is this effect? Does it have a positive effect (increasing it) or a negative effect (decreasing it)? How strong is this effect?","Personal privacy concerns can have a big effect on support for surveillance, and whether it's positive or negative depends on whether you share the same personal privacy concerns."
15,"Is the effect of Community trust on Support for surveillance camera immediate, or does it take time to develop? Does it have a positive effect (increasing it) or a negative effect (decreasing it)? How strong is this effect?",I think it takes to develop depending on their past experiences with surveillance technologies and can be positive or negative depending on whether you have trust or not on surveillance technologies.
16,"Would small changes in Consent lead to noticeable changes in Support for surveillance camera, or would it take larger shifts? Does it have a positive effect (increasing it) or a negative effect (decreasing it)? How strong is this effect?","I think it would lead to noticeable changes if the consent is clearly defined, and can be stronged."
17,"Does Opposition to Surveillance Systems have a positive or negative effect on Support for surveillance camera, and how significant is this effect? Does it have a positive effect (increasing it) or a negative effect (decreasing it)? How strong is this effect?",Well opposition can have a big effect on support for surveillance technologies and whether it's positive or negative depends on how you see those technologies. So basically whether you oppose it or are in favor of it.
18,How confident are you that changes in Surveillance policy lead to changes in Support for surveillance camera? Does it have a positive effect (increasing it) or a negative effect (decreasing it)? How strong is this effect?,"Um, I think it can lead to changes in support if, um, the surveillance policy is clearly defined and can be, the effect can, the effect can be strong. And again, a positive or negative effect depends on whether you are in favor of that surveillance policy or not."
19,How confident are you that changes in Equal Treatment lead to changes in Support for surveillance camera? Does it have a positive effect (increasing it) or a negative effect (decreasing it)? How strong is this effect?,"It can lead to big changes if you are part of a group who thinks that you are not receiving equal treatment and its effects can be strong. Again, whether it is positive or negative depends on whether you view equal treatment as an important factor."
20,"Is the effect of Surveillance technology on Support for surveillance camera immediate, or does it take time to develop? Does it have a positive effect (increasing it) or a negative effect (decreasing it)? How strong is this effect?","Yes, it can be immediate or take a long time to develop depending on whether people think the surveillance technology is reliable or not."
21,"Is the effect of Effect on support for surveillance cameras on Support for surveillance camera immediate, or does it take time to develop? Does it have a positive effect (increasing it) or a negative effect (decreasing it)? How strong is this effect?","Um, I don't know what you are trying to say, it does not make sense what you are asking."
22,How confident are you that changes in Time-dependent Development lead to changes in Support for surveillance camera? Does it have a positive effect (increasing it) or a negative effect (decreasing it)? How strong is this effect?,"I don't know what time-dependent development is, can you explain it?"
23,How confident are you that changes in Support for surveillance cameras lead to changes in Support for surveillance camera? Does it have a positive effect (increasing it) or a negative effect (decreasing it)? How strong is this effect?,uh you are being redundant and going using circular logic it does not make sense what you're trying to say
24,"Would small changes in Positive effect of trust lead to noticeable changes in Support for surveillance camera, or would it take larger shifts? Does it have a positive effect (increasing it) or a negative effect (decreasing it)? How strong is this effect?","It can lead to noticeable changes in support for surveillance technology if there is an increase in trust and its effect can be strong. Again, it depends if it's positive or negative depending on where you are on the side of having increased trust or not."
25,What causes changes in Surveillance cameras? Are these influences strong or weak?,"Yeah, your question does not make sense."
