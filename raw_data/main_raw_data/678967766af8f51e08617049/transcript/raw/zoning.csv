6,Excellent! We're now ready to begin the interview about urban zoning policies. Take your time with each response and provide as much detail as you'd like. Let's start with our first question.,ok
7,To what extent do you support or oppose upzoning policies that allow for higher density housing in traditionally single-family neighborhoods? Please explain your reasoning.,"I moderately oppose it because it creates crowding, noise, and lack of parking and a change in the way the neighborhood looks and was originally designed, period. If I move into a neighborhood because it is a single-family neighborhood, it changes when high-rises are built. I didn't sign up for that."
8,"What do you think are the most significant impacts, positive or negative, of increasing housing density in residential neighborhoods?","Lack of parking, more noise, more crowding in general."
9,How do you think upzoning policies might affect housing affordability in urban areas?,"It will either have no effect or make it less affordable because new developments are being built at much higher rents than existing residences, and landlords of the existing residences want to raise their rents to match."
10,What impact do you believe increased housing density might have on neighborhood character and quality of life?,"It changes it from a quiet family neighborhood feel to more of a bustling city feel. Even living in a large city, you can go home to your quiet neighborhood and escape it, but not if it's all turned into high-rises and bustling cities even within smaller neighborhoods."
11,How do you think upzoning might affect transportation systems and traffic congestion in cities?,"Traffic would definitely be more congested, especially during rush hours and school hours."
12,What role do you believe local government should play in regulating housing development and density?,Government should limit the amount of densities
13,How might environmental concerns factor into decisions about urban density and zoning?,"There will be more smog, more pollution, more trash, just more of everything that harms the environment when you add more people and put them into a condensed space."
14,"What economic effects, both positive and negative, might result from changing zoning laws to allow more multi-family housing?",More people will mean more business for local businesses for sure.
15,How do you think the interests of current residents versus future residents should be balanced when making zoning decisions?,"Current residents, especially homeowners, should have a voice in what happens to their neighborhoods."
16,What role do you think social equity and access to opportunity play in discussions about zoning and housing policy?,"It should play a role, but there's plenty of land to build on without overpopulating certain neighborhoods."
17,How confident are you that changes in Higher density housing lead to changes in Support for Upzoning? Does it have a positive effect (increasing it) or a negative effect (decreasing it)? How strong is this effect?,I don't know. I'm not really clear on the question.
18,"What factors affect Support for Upzoning, and which ones have the strongest influence? Please also indicate if these influences are positive (increasing) or negative (decreasing).",Lack of affordable housing has a big support for upzoning and seems to be very influential. I don't know why though because upzoning does not create affordable housing. It creates housing for more financially well-off people and is basically gentrification.
19,"Does Lack of parking have a positive or negative effect on Support for Upzoning, and how significant is this effect? Does it have a positive effect (increasing it) or a negative effect (decreasing it)? How strong is this effect?","Lack of parking definitely has a negative effect on support for upzoning and the effects are significant. There's nothing about upzoning that creates parking, which is already an issue, even if the buildings are built with additional parking for their tenants. It doesn't address parking locally at businesses, etc."
20,How confident are you that changes in New developments lead to changes in Support for Upzoning? Does it have a positive effect (increasing it) or a negative effect (decreasing it)? How strong is this effect?,I'm not sure what new changes and new developments you're referring to.
21,How confident are you that changes in High-rises lead to changes in Support for Upzoning? Does it have a positive effect (increasing it) or a negative effect (decreasing it)? How strong is this effect?,I'm not sure what changes and high-rises you're referring to.
22,"Would small changes in Density limits lead to noticeable changes in Support for Upzoning, or would it take larger shifts? Does it have a positive effect (increasing it) or a negative effect (decreasing it)? How strong is this effect?","I think changes to density limits, if it's increasing it, will not have support for oxidation. If it was going to happen anyway and it was limited to a certain number allowed in a certain neighborhood or a limit on the amounts of units in a building, it could create support for upzoning."
23,How confident are you that changes in Environmental harm lead to changes in Support for Upzoning? Does it have a positive effect (increasing it) or a negative effect (decreasing it)? How strong is this effect?,I really don't think environmental harm plays enough of a part either way to have an effect on upzoning and whether or not it occurs. It's not an argument that I really hear for or against when you're talking about upzoning.
24,How confident are you that changes in Local business growth lead to changes in Support for Upzoning? Does it have a positive effect (increasing it) or a negative effect (decreasing it)? How strong is this effect?,"I'm pretty sure that local businesses would have a high support for upzoning as it creates more revenue and foot traffic for them. It would definitely be a positive effect for them, especially when they run businesses in the neighborhood that are being upzoned and don't live there anyway."
25,How would you describe the relationship between Homeowners' influence and Support for Upzoning? Is it a strong or weak connection? Does it have a positive effect (increasing it) or a negative effect (decreasing it)? How strong is this effect?,I think homeowners have a very large influence on upzoning. I think the connection is very strong. I think homeowners are the most vocal about upzoning and the most vocal about being against it and see it as a negative. Homeowners have a lot more to consider and have a lot more investment in the neighborhoods than anybody else.
26,"Is the effect of Zoning Policy on Support for Upzoning immediate, or does it take time to develop? Does it have a positive effect (increasing it) or a negative effect (decreasing it)? How strong is this effect?","It takes time to develop. A lot of it is done in hindsight after the developments have already taken place, and we see how things played out. I think then once we see what the effects of upzoning are, is when we see whether it's positive or negative, and how big an effect it is."
27,"Is the effect of Upzoning on Support for Upzoning immediate, or does it take time to develop? Does it have a positive effect (increasing it) or a negative effect (decreasing it)? How strong is this effect?","I think it takes time to develop, but it develops at a fairly rapid place, especially once upzoning begins. The effects are immediate, whether negative or positive, and not hard to see."
28,How confident are you that changes in Negative effect on support for upzoning lead to changes in Support for Upzoning? Does it have a positive effect (increasing it) or a negative effect (decreasing it)? How strong is this effect?,If negative support becomes positive it can positively impact support for upzoning.
29,"Does Significant effect have a positive or negative effect on Support for Upzoning, and how significant is this effect? Does it have a positive effect (increasing it) or a negative effect (decreasing it)? How strong is this effect?","It depends on if the effects are negative or positive, how significant they are, and whether the support for upzoning is negative or positive in response to it. I think either way, it will have a strong effect."
30,"What factors do you think influence Upzoning policies, and how strong is their impact? Please also indicate if these influences are positive (increasing) or negative (decreasing).","The reason for upzoning, community outcry, local business demands, current infrastructure suitability all play a part and have a strong impact. They can be negative or positive depending on who you ask."
31,"Does Strong Connection have a positive or negative effect on Support for Upzoning, and how significant is this effect? Does it have a positive effect (increasing it) or a negative effect (decreasing it)? How strong is this effect?",It can have a negative effect if the strong connection is not in support for upzoning and vice versa. I think the effect is significant. It can be positive if there's more support for it or negative if there's not.
32,"Would small changes in Hindsight lead to noticeable changes in Support for Upzoning, or would it take larger shifts? Does it have a positive effect (increasing it) or a negative effect (decreasing it)? How strong is this effect?","I think small changes would lead to noticeable changes in support for upzoning, depending on what those changes were. I think over time, it could take larger shifts. It could have a positive effect or a negative effect if larger changes were made too fast in response to smaller changes that were noticed in hindsight."
33,"Does Strength of Effect have a positive or negative effect on Support for Upzoning, and how significant is this effect? Does it have a positive effect (increasing it) or a negative effect (decreasing it)? How strong is this effect?",I don't understand the question.
34,"What factors do you think influence Lack of parking, and how strong is their impact? Please also indicate if these influences are positive (increasing) or negative (decreasing).","more people = more vehicles, therefore lack of parking in neighborhoods and at local businesses. This is negative. Its an impact that is important to residents but I dont think its important enough to developers or govt. to deter building."
