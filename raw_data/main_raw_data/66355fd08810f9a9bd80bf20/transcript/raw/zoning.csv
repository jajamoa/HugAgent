5,"As the interview progresses, you'll notice the progress bar at the top of the screen showing your current position. Based on your responses, the system may generate follow-up questions to dive deeper into specific topics. These new questions will be added to your interview flow automatically. This helps us capture your thinking process more thoroughly.",Sounds good.
6,Excellent! We're now ready to begin the interview about urban zoning policies. Take your time with each response and provide as much detail as you'd like. Let's start with our first question.,Okay.
7,To what extent do you support or oppose upzoning policies that allow for higher density housing in traditionally single-family neighborhoods? Please explain your reasoning.,"I pretty much oppose that. The neighborhood that I live in is currently doing this, and we already have schools, it's completely full, car lines are out of control, traffic is terrible, and I understand the reasoning behind it, but it feels wrong to put in single family neighborhoods."
8,"What do you think are the most significant impacts, positive or negative, of increasing housing density in residential neighborhoods?",It's negative from a mother and family point of view. I'm sure businesses like it. I'm sure property tax collectors like it. But I feel like it's taking away the greenery from the neighborhood that we had and just making it more stressful to go anywhere. It's so busy.
9,How do you think upzoning policies might affect housing affordability in urban areas?,"I don't know. They always say it could reduce costs, but even one-bedroom apartments where I live cost $1,800, which is what my mortgage is, so I don't see just them building upward isn't going to make it cheaper. It'll probably cost just as much, but just triple our traffic."
10,What impact do you believe increased housing density might have on neighborhood character and quality of life?,"Quality of life will go down because everybody is out and I don't live in a walkable city. We all drive So you put a thousand people into an up zoned building and now there's a thousand cars so that just Brings down quality of life Character. Yeah, I mean it's kind of an eyesore, but they could build really nice quality luxury ones, I suppose"
11,How do you think upzoning might affect transportation systems and traffic congestion in cities?,"My county and my city don't have any transportation systems. There are no buses, no nothing, so traffic congestion is already pretty bad and you add more of these up zonings, which they're doing, and it's already made a negative impact and how long it takes to get somewhere and we all have to drive."
12,What role do you believe local government should play in regulating housing development and density?,I believe local and federal should have a say in this. You shouldn't just be allowed to say yes to all of this when everyone who lives here says no and we already have some of the highest property taxes in our state of Georgia. So I feel like our government should listen to us and do their job.
13,How might environmental concerns factor into decisions about urban density and zoning?,"This is where government pretends they care. They're trying to build a gigantic data center in the city next to me, same county, and they had a bajillion people show up and fight this over and over again and it's still being approved. Yeah, environmental concerns definitely factor in, but anyone who puts their hand out to collect money for this deal is going to say yes."
14,"What economic effects, both positive and negative, might result from changing zoning laws to allow more multi-family housing?","For business owners, it's probably good for them because more people in the same small area, the more chances you have of people visiting your restaurant or your store. So from that aspect, it's good for business owners. It's just not good for the people who actually live here, work here, drive here."
15,How do you think the interests of current residents versus future residents should be balanced when making zoning decisions?,"think the interest of current residents should be the heaviest balance. It pisses me off when you have tons of us showing up at these town halls, showing up at these hearings, and we're all together saying no please, and they completely ignore us and pass this crap anyway. Then the stuff gets built, more people come, there's more traffic, but our property taxes have gone up every single year regardless of all this. You're taking in tons more property taxes from all those housing developments you've built. Why is my single-family home taxes going up every year? It's BS."
16,What role do you think social equity and access to opportunity play in discussions about zoning and housing policy?,"I think this is a tool that people who make money off of building this crap pretends that it helps with equity and access. It absolutely does not. They're not building government housing or anything like that. These places are like luxury, luxury apartments. They cost more than my house to live in. So I think it's a load of crap when people pretend that this somehow eases the burden for people who can't find homes. It's not that people can't find homes. It's that people aren't paid enough to afford them anymore and inflation has made it even harder. Pay people more and don't inflate the cost of everything. My house price has doubled in seven years. That's ridiculous."
17,"Is the effect of Higher density housing on Support for Upzoning immediate, or does it take time to develop? Does it have a positive effect (increasing it) or a negative effect (decreasing it)? How strong is this effect?","I think some effects are immediate traffic, for example. Others will take time to develop. Like, does this potentially bring more crime? Does this potentially bring a de-beautification of the roadsides? All these cars, are they throwing out trash? Did we hire more people to help clean up that trash? That sort of thing. It's like that broken window effect, you know, it could, you know, one broken window, the next house, let theirs go without repair. And the next thing you know, your whole neighborhood looks like that."
18,"What might lead to increases or decreases in Support for Upzoning, and how significant are these effects? Please also indicate if these influences are positive (increasing) or negative (decreasing).","You could increase support for upzoning by actually making these houses super affordable, obviously. You could make the support for upzoning increase exponentially by very much so lowering the property taxes that we are all currently paying in this county. I've mentioned before ours are almost the highest in Georgia, if not the highest, and they go up every year. The influence would be positive if you brought down costs."
19,"Is the effect of Housing affordability on Support for Upzoning immediate, or does it take time to develop? Does it have a positive effect (increasing it) or a negative effect (decreasing it)? How strong is this effect?","Yeah, if you advertise, hey, you know, one-bedroom apartments cost $1,800, these new up-zoned buildings are going to cost $1,000 a month, you would have a ton of support for that right away from people who are struggling to afford to live, which is probably over half the country. So in that way, it would be a positive effect by decreasing costs. There is no positive effect for costs going up. People are struggling."
20,"Does Traffic congestion have a positive or negative effect on Support for Upzoning, and how significant is this effect? Does it have a positive effect (increasing it) or a negative effect (decreasing it)? How strong is this effect?","Where I live, traffic congestion was already a big problem. It has become a massive problem over the last seven years. They are building tons of apartment complexes, and they are now starting to upzone, like our Costco is upzoning. The effect on traffic congestion is extremely significant. It definitely decreases support for upzoning, I think, for obvious reasons. One of the main reasons."
21,How would you describe the relationship between Local government role and Support for Upzoning? Is it a strong or weak connection? Does it have a positive effect (increasing it) or a negative effect (decreasing it)? How strong is this effect?,"The relationship between local government and support for upzoning is direct. I feel like there must be kickbacks or something because our local government completely ignores everyone who lives here, every one of our voices. They completely tune us out and they just approve everything. Tons of gas stations, tons of liquor stores, tons of apartment complexes that literally none of us want. It's a pretty strong connection between local government and upzoning support."
22,How confident are you that changes in Public opposition lead to changes in Support for Upzoning? Does it have a positive effect (increasing it) or a negative effect (decreasing it)? How strong is this effect?,"Well, the public are the ones who have to live with these upzoning changes. So if you don't have public support for upzoning, you're going to have public opposition. They are inverse of each other. Make it affordable, somehow decrease traffic, and you would increase public support. But that's not what they're doing. It's going to remain negative."
23,"Is the effect of Increased population density on Support for Upzoning immediate, or does it take time to develop? Does it have a positive effect (increasing it) or a negative effect (decreasing it)? How strong is this effect?","I think the effect is pretty immediate. You know, you build 10 apartment complexes, each one holds 200 apartments, and bam, that's all in a three-mile area. Now guess what? People are living there and driving from there. They're all on the roads with us and they weren't here a year ago. That's definitely going to have a negative effect on support. Population density is an issue."
24,How would you describe the relationship between Property taxes and Support for Upzoning? Is it a strong or weak connection? Does it have a positive effect (increasing it) or a negative effect (decreasing it)? How strong is this effect?,Strong connection. For sure our property taxes are crazy high. They are building all this crap and our property taxes still go up every year. They haven't lowered them at all even though they're bringing in millions more with all the housing that they've built and filled. It's really not fair and they do nothing about it even though we all do use our voice.
25,"Would small changes in Town hall participation lead to noticeable changes in Support for Upzoning, or would it take larger shifts? Does it have a positive effect (increasing it) or a negative effect (decreasing it)? How strong is this effect?","It seems to make no difference. We used to have tiny town hall participation, if they even held town halls. Over the last five years, participation in town halls and hearings has exploded because of social media. We organize, we plan, we voice our concerns and we come prepared in absolute opposition to the continuously saying yes to every single apartment complex and up zone. I don't know what it would take. We have voted certain people out and they continue to say yes and put their hand out. I don't know how you stop that. It's a pretty strong effect and problem."
26,How would you describe the relationship between Luxury Apartments and Support for Upzoning? Is it a strong or weak connection? Does it have a positive effect (increasing it) or a negative effect (decreasing it)? How strong is this effect?,I think obviously luxury apartments are more desirable to look at and have in your community than cheaper apartments or builder grade everything or government housing. I don't think any of these have a positive effect. None of these things are wanted where I live. So I'm not I'm not really sure how you would improve on that when people don't want this. We prefer single-family homes. I don't know why we can't build normal starter single-family homes like we used to back when boomers were buying homes. Why does everything have to be crammed all together?
27,"Is the effect of Affordability of Homes on Support for Upzoning immediate, or does it take time to develop? Does it have a positive effect (increasing it) or a negative effect (decreasing it)? How strong is this effect?","I don't think anyone believes this is going to make housing more affordable. This is just a lie they tell us to get this stuff passed and pushed through. The reason I say that is because they have built a crap ton of apartment complexes in my county over the past few years, but home prices and apartment rentals have all gone up and property taxes have continued to go up. So they're saying that it's going to affect the affordability of homes in a positive way is not truthful. No one trusts it and it's not going to build support because we know we're being lied to."
28,How would you describe the relationship between Immediate effects and Support for Upzoning? Is it a strong or weak connection? Does it have a positive effect (increasing it) or a negative effect (decreasing it)? How strong is this effect?,"Immediate effects, if they're positive, probably increase support for upzoning. But overall, I just think it's a negative. It's not something that the suburbs wanted. We don't live in a giant city. We didn't want our suburbs to become that way. So it's a negative effect overall, regardless of how they spin it."
29,How would you describe the relationship between Upzoning support and Support for Upzoning? Is it a strong or weak connection? Does it have a positive effect (increasing it) or a negative effect (decreasing it)? How strong is this effect?,"I don't understand that question, the relationship between upzoning support and support for upzoning. I guess they're inverse, right? Because people don't want it."
30,"What do you think are the main causes of Upzoning policies, and how certain are you about these relationships? Please also indicate if these influences are positive (increasing) or negative (decreasing).","I think the main causes are money. They must get a lot of money for the city when they pass this stuff and let these things be built. I don't know what the transparency is on that. I've not looked it up, but I assume there must be a positive for government officials who say yes to this stuff or they wouldn't say yes to everything. Like they live in these communities too. They can drive the streets and see that it's not desirable to have this stuff, so I'm not really sure why all the yes. I'm not sure what is the main cause if not money or gain in some way."
31,How confident are you that changes in Negative effect lead to changes in Support for Upzoning? Does it have a positive effect (increasing it) or a negative effect (decreasing it)? How strong is this effect?,"Negative effects absolutely lead to less support for upzoning. I'm very confident in that. You know, more traffic, that's a negative. Lessened support. More trash on the roads, potentially more crime. Schools are now too full and so your kid has to go to class in an un-air-conditioned trailer because their school can't hold the number of new, the number of students who've come since we've built all this. Negative effects definitely decrease support. Positive effects would increase support."
32,"Does Population density have a positive or negative effect on Support for Upzoning, and how significant is this effect? Does it have a positive effect (increasing it) or a negative effect (decreasing it)? How strong is this effect?","Population density is definitely an issue. I don't see how packing even more people into a smaller area with up zoning is going to help that problem. So I don't really understand why they word it that way. It's not, you know, these people don't live here now. You're building all this stuff to bring them here. I think there's other ways that we could deal with population density and the lack of affordable housing. There's other ways to do this besides this model."
