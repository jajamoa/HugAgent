Question Number,Question,Answer
1,To what extent do you support or oppose universal healthcare policies that provide government-funded healthcare coverage for all citizens? Please explain your reasoning.,I definitely support universal health care policies that provide government-funded health care coverage for all citizens because I think everyone needs an equal chance to have health care coverage.
2,"What do you think are the most significant impacts, positive or negative, of implementing a universal healthcare system?",I think the most significant impacts would be everyone has the ability to go to a doctor and doesn't need to be afraid of cost. That's a positive impact. Negative might be getting health care through an employer if that option was still available. They would probably make it more expensive.
3,How do you think universal healthcare policies might affect healthcare quality and accessibility?,"I think quality and accessibility would be generally the same, although accessibility would definitely increase for everyone."
4,What impact do you believe a universal healthcare system might have on medical innovation and research?,I think if everyone has access to healthcare then doctors would be getting more information so I think it would have a positive effect on medical innovation and research.
5,How do you think universal healthcare might affect the economic burden on individuals and families?,I don't know if it would be an economic burden to individuals and families unless the government doesn't pay for it and expects everyone to pay more on taxes for it. And that could be bad.
6,What role do you believe government should play in healthcare delivery and financing?,I think government should just pay for finance and make it happen. I don't think it's up to people to have to pay for this.
7,How might healthcare provider concerns factor into decisions about universal healthcare implementation?,The only reason I would have any healthcare provider concerns is if I'm not able to see a particular provider that I want to see because of restrictions.
8,"What economic effects, both positive and negative, might result from transitioning to a universal healthcare system?",I think economic doctors could potentially struggle or see a change. Hospitals might see a change but if government is able to find a way to pay them then it wouldn't really be too much of a change for them but it could be negative I guess if people aren't paying them out of pocket.
9,How do you think the interests of taxpayers versus healthcare consumers should be balanced when making healthcare policy?,"I think taxpayers don't want to pay a ton of money just to be able to afford this, so we need to make sure taxpayers aren't paying way too much."
10,What role do you think social equity and access to care play in discussions about healthcare policy?,Social inequality absolutely contributes to lack of access to health care and so this is when it becomes important to talk about universal health care policies.
11,"Is the effect of Government-funded healthcare on Support for universal healthcare immediate, or does it take time to develop? Does it have a positive effect (increasing it) or a negative effect (decreasing it)? How strong is this effect?",I think the effect of government-funded healthcare would be immediate because people would see changes to what they're paying as soon as they need to go to the doctor for any reason and more people would suddenly be able to go.
12,How would you describe the relationship between Equal access to healthcare and Support for universal healthcare? Is it a strong or weak connection? Does it have a positive effect (increasing it) or a negative effect (decreasing it)? How strong is this effect?,"Equal access to health care and support are directly related. If everybody has access, more people would probably support it, the people who can't afford to go now."
13,"Is the effect of Fear of medical costs on Support for universal healthcare immediate, or does it take time to develop? Does it have a positive effect (increasing it) or a negative effect (decreasing it)? How strong is this effect?",Fear of medical costs has a direct reflection because if people are afraid of rising costs they're going to support immediate changes like government universal health care.
14,"What do you think are the main causes of Support for universal healthcare, and how certain are you about these relationships? Please also indicate if these influences are positive (increasing) or negative (decreasing).","The main causes of support for universal health care would be fears of rising costs, inability to access it because of costs, and really just rising costs in general. They're very strong influences when people can't afford health care, so they can't get it."
15,How would you describe the relationship between Healthcare accessibility and Support for universal healthcare? Is it a strong or weak connection? Does it have a positive effect (increasing it) or a negative effect (decreasing it)? How strong is this effect?,Healthcare accessibility has a strong direct impact on support for universal healthcare because if people don't have access to healthcare they're going to want universal healthcare.
16,"Would small changes in Increased access to healthcare lead to noticeable changes in Support for universal healthcare, or would it take larger shifts? Does it have a positive effect (increasing it) or a negative effect (decreasing it)? How strong is this effect?","I think small changes in increased access to health care would lead to noticeable changes in support for universal health care because when people are able to finally start going to the doctors and not have to worry about cost, they're definitely going to support it."
17,"Is the effect of Economic burden on Support for universal healthcare immediate, or does it take time to develop? Does it have a positive effect (increasing it) or a negative effect (decreasing it)? How strong is this effect?","Economic burden might decrease the cost for universal health care, but I don't think it's immediate. I think it's going to take more time to develop so people can see what the economic burden is exactly."
18,How would you describe the relationship between Healthcare provider choice and Support for universal healthcare? Is it a strong or weak connection? Does it have a positive effect (increasing it) or a negative effect (decreasing it)? How strong is this effect?,I think as long as people can still see the health care provider they want then they'll support it but it definitely would have a direct link I just don't know if it would be positive or negative because people don't just want to be thrown to a random doctor just to see a doctor.
19,"Would small changes in Economic effects lead to noticeable changes in Support for universal healthcare, or would it take larger shifts? Does it have a positive effect (increasing it) or a negative effect (decreasing it)? How strong is this effect?","I think small changes in economic effects would lead to a noticeable change in support for health care, but I don't think it would change the support very much and I don't know if it'd be negative or positive, probably negative."
20,How confident are you that changes in Affordability lead to changes in Support for universal healthcare? Does it have a positive effect (increasing it) or a negative effect (decreasing it)? How strong is this effect?,"Changes in affordability would definitely lead to changes in support for universal health care. That'd be a strong positive effect. I mean, if people are afraid of affordability of health care, then they're going to want universal health care."
21,"Is the effect of Access to health care on Support for universal healthcare immediate, or does it take time to develop? Does it have a positive effect (increasing it) or a negative effect (decreasing it)? How strong is this effect?",I think the effect of access to health care would be immediate because people would suddenly be able to go and it would have a positive effect and people would definitely support it more.
22,How confident are you that changes in Increased accessibility lead to changes in Support for universal healthcare? Does it have a positive effect (increasing it) or a negative effect (decreasing it)? How strong is this effect?,"I'm pretty confident that changes in increased accessibility would lead to changes in support for universal healthcare because when people are able to go to the doctor and they haven't been able to, they'll support it."
23,"What factors affect Government-funded healthcare, and which ones have the strongest influence? Please also indicate if these influences are positive (increasing) or negative (decreasing).","Government-funded health care would depend on where the funds come from. So if it comes from taxes, that's going to affect how people do or don't support it, and it depends on how much people are going to have to pay."
24,"Would small changes in Inability to access healthcare due to costs lead to noticeable changes in Support for universal healthcare, or would it take larger shifts? Does it have a positive effect (increasing it) or a negative effect (decreasing it)? How strong is this effect?",I think small changes in inability to access health care due to costs would lead to noticeable changes in support for universal health care because when people suddenly can't go to the doctor they're going to support universal health care instead.
25,How would you describe the relationship between Positive effect and Support for universal healthcare? Is it a strong or weak connection? Does it have a positive effect (increasing it) or a negative effect (decreasing it)? How strong is this effect?,"I think positive effect and support for universal health care are directly related. It's a very strong impact. If people notice a very positive effect from it, they're going to support it."
26,"Is the effect of Strong Connection on Support for universal healthcare immediate, or does it take time to develop? Does it have a positive effect (increasing it) or a negative effect (decreasing it)? How strong is this effect?","I don't understand what you mean by strong connection on support. You mean if people support healthcare? Or if people have a connection to universal healthcare? I mean, I think if people have a strong connection to their universal healthcare, they will support it. And if not, then they will not support it."
