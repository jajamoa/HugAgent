Question Number,Question,Answer
1,To what extent do you support or oppose universal healthcare policies that provide government-funded healthcare coverage for all citizens? Please explain your reasoning.,I strongly support universal healthcare policies that provide government funded healthcare coverage for all citizens! I believe that access to healthcare is a fundamental right not a privilege. I also believe that a universal healthcare system has the potential to reduce inequality in our society and communities. The piece of mine that comes with knowing that everyone is covered as invaluable.As someone living in lewistown and caring about the well-being of my community in the nation I support government funded universal healthcare coverage for all citizens because it aligns with my beliefs and what I believe in offering security and peace of mind for all!
2,"What do you think are the most significant impacts, positive or negative, of implementing a universal healthcare system?","For me the potential positive impacts of making sure everyone has access to healthcare improving public health and reducing financial burdens are very compelling! But the potential negative impacts are increased taxes and the risk of bureaucracy and even longer wait times, our significant concerns that would need to seriously be carefully addressed in the implementation of any universal healthcare. The key would be to make a healthcare system that maximize the benefits while reducing the drawbacks for everyone in Lewistown and world!"
3,How do you think universal healthcare policies might affect healthcare quality and accessibility?,"I believe that a well designed universal healthcare policies have the potential to significantly increase accessibility to healthcare for everyone in Lewistown and the United States. It could potentially lead to improvements through a focus on prevention, standardization and value based car b ur there are potential risks for example waiting times, constraints on choice that would need to be carefully evaluated through thoughtful policy design and implementation. For me it would be to create a system that not only ensures universal access but also maintains and improves the quality care for everyone."
4,What impact do you believe a universal healthcare system might have on medical innovation and research?,"a universal system being government funded and focused on the health of the entire nation as a whole might prioritize research and innovation in areas that address the most significant public health challenges, facing communities like mine. This could lead to more research in preventative care, disease management and health disparities. In our current system research priorities sometimes be influenced by the potential for high profits. A universal system might help shift the focus towards research that benefits all people/most people regardless of the market size. some potential negatives would be the pharmaceutical and medical device companies are heavily driven by profit."
5,How do you think universal healthcare might affect the economic burden on individuals and families?,"A universal system with government negotiation of drug prices and tighter control over healthcare spending could reduce the potential for high profits in my opinion! Leading to less investment and research and development by private companies. Limited funding for highly specialized or rare conditions and disabilities. in my opinion, it’s a mix of both positive and negative. Depending on how the system is implemented and designed."
6,What role do you believe government should play in healthcare delivery and financing?,"To maximize the positive impacts and reduce the -ones a universal healthcare system would need to bVe consistent funding for medical research, both public and private. Protect researchers from political interference and influence. Fostering international collaboration and sharing of knowledge. The goal would be to create a system that provides universal access to high-quality care and fostering a dynamic environment for medical innovation that benefits everyone."
7,How might healthcare provider concerns factor into decisions about universal healthcare implementation?,Ignoring the concerns of healthcare provides is a recipe for disaster in  implementing universal healthcare in my opinion. Policy makers would need to find a balance between the goals of universal access and affordability with a need to support the healthcare professionals who would be delivering the patient care. Addressing their concerns through thoughtful policy decisions and design along with adequate funding and ongoing collaborations would be crucial for a high-quality as sustainable universal healthcare system for everyone in Lewistown and the world.

9,How do you think the interests of taxpayers versus healthcare consumers should be balanced when making healthcare policy?,But the prospect of increased taxes especially since I am not working right now and taking a leave from work to take care of my son who is special needs and has autism and is nonverbal is a serious major concern. I would need to see a clear plan that demonstrates how the benefits would outweigh the costs for families like mine and ensure the access to quality care for my son is not compromised in anyway. The details of how much a system would be funded and implemented would be detrimental in determining its overall economic impact on society and my own family.
10,What role do you think social equity and access to care play in discussions about healthcare policy?,As someone caring for a child with autism a special needs the discussions about social equity and access to care are deeply personal for me. My son requires ongoing therapies and specialized medical attention so a healthcare that prioritizes social equity and ensuring access would provide a much needed safety net and allow him to teach his full potential without our family constantly worrying about how we’ll afford his care. It’s about the wellbeing and dignity of everyone in our community.

We often have to fight for access to specialized care, navigate complex insurance rules, and worry about the financial burden of it all.

If I see evidence of high profits being prioritized over patient care and access, it reinforces my conviction that a universal system, where the focus is on people's health needs rather than private gain, is the better approach. The more I perceive high profits as a problem in the current system, the more strongly I will likely support a universal alternative."

30,"What might lead to increases or decreases in Universal healthcare, and how significant are these effects? Please also indicate if these influences are positive (increasing) or negative (decreasing).","The path towards or away from universal healthcare in the US, including in Lewistown, will likely be shaped by a complex interplay of public demand, political will, economic conditions, the influence of powerful interest groups, and the effectiveness of arguments for and against it. Significant increases are more likely when there's a strong public consensus that the current system is failing and a compelling vision for a better, more equitable alternative emerges with strong political backing. Decreases in momentum can occur due to strong opposition, economic shifts, or a lack of sustained political will."
31,"What might lead to increases or decreases in Reduction of inequality, and how significant are these effects? Please also indicate if these influences are positive (increasing) or negative (decreasing).","For me, the implementation and strengthening of universal healthcare are the most significant factors that could lead to a reduction in healthcare inequality in Lewistown and the US. However, broader social and economic policies, as well as a commitment to addressing systemic biases within the healthcare system, also play crucial roles. weakening social safety nets or rolling back universal access initiatives would likely lead to greater inequality. The significance of these effects can range from slight to significant, with systemic policy changes having the most l impact."
