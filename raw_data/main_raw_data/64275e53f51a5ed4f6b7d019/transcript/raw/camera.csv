Does it have a positive effect (increasing it) or a negative effect (decreasing it)? How strong is this effect?","It has both. If they can't guarantee cameras won't leak out personal info, then there will be low support. If they can guarantee security of data is tight, then support will be strong."
18,How would you describe the relationship between Accuracy and Support for surveillance camera? Is it a strong or weak connection? Does it have a positive effect (increasing it) or a negative effect (decreasing it)? How strong is this effect?,"Of course it has a strong relationship. The more efficient a camera is in capturing the images of the criminals, the easier the cops can catch them, which then proves that the cameras are efficient and so support will grow."
