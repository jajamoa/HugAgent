    "housing_experience": "I moved a couple of times from late 2010s to early 2020s. This was due to trying to find a better location and cost since some of the people we were with previously would not be staying. The places were rented and were small apartment buildings. The owners of the building were slow when it came to responding to issue such as the fridge being broken, and were acting greedy regarding the end lease when moving. I now live in a house which means more space, and feels less crowded in general.",
