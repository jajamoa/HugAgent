5,"As the interview progresses, you'll notice the progress bar at the top of the screen showing your current position. Based on your responses, the system may generate follow-up questions to dive deeper into specific topics. These new questions will be added to your interview flow automatically. This helps us capture your thinking process more thoroughly.",Mm-hmm.
6,Excellent! We're now ready to begin the interview about urban zoning policies. Take your time with each response and provide as much detail as you'd like. Let's start with our first question.,Okay.
7,To what extent do you support or oppose upzoning policies that allow for higher density housing in traditionally single-family neighborhoods? Please explain your reasoning.,I'm a bit indifferent about it because you know I think it's pretty nice to have buildings for where people can't afford homes but at the same time I feel like it's gonna be a bit too crowded. I don't know.
8,"What do you think are the most significant impacts, positive or negative, of increasing housing density in residential neighborhoods?","I think the most significant impacts would probably be the cost, because since like, you know, people will be living in the building, right, that's like, well, basically an apartment, so it's cheaper, right, cheaper than a home. So I think that's pretty positive. Negative though, I think it'd be a bit too crowded, a bit too noisy too, like, I'll be having cars around my neighborhood, like, you know, arriving, right, that's already annoying enough. So I can't really imagine how loud having a bunch of people like, you know, around my neighborhood be, if there are buildings, yeah."
9,How do you think upzoning policies might affect housing affordability in urban areas?,"I mean, would it really make any difference though, like, house prices in this economy right now, which were really expensive, I can't really imagine making like, a big difference, to be honest."
10,What impact do you believe increased housing density might have on neighborhood character and quality of life?,"I feel like, I mean, my neighborhood is already pretty safe, so I can't really like say much about it, but I guess that having more housing density, I think it would make the neighborhoods I guess more lively, I guess, like it would be like more people outside, which is good, I guess, yeah."
11,How do you think upzoning might affect transportation systems and traffic congestion in cities?,"I mean, I think like obviously that it's going to be a lot more crowded, so uh, you know, that's really it. It's going to be a lot more crowded and I guess you have to live with it, that's it. Yeah."
12,What role do you believe local government should play in regulating housing development and density?,"I'm not going to lie with you, I have no idea what the local government is going to do. I don't know, to be honest with you. I can say either support it or oppose it. That's it."
13,How might environmental concerns factor into decisions about urban density and zoning?,"Maybe the air quality would probably be a bit bad, but I think that depends on like your neighborhood and like, you know, what kind of people you're going to have. I'd say that my neighborhood is okay. It's pretty, uh, pretty healthy, right? So maybe having buildings around my neighborhood, right? A bunch of people around them. I don't think it'd be that bad. My city's pretty safe, I think."
14,"What economic effects, both positive and negative, might result from changing zoning laws to allow more multi-family housing?","To me, I feel like for prices when it comes to houses and apartments, you know, anything in general right, I don't think there's that much of a difference, positive or negative. Like I said, you know what, a couple of takes back right, the economy right, it's pretty bad, housing prices are pretty high. So I don't really think there's that much of a difference, yeah."
15,How do you think the interests of current residents versus future residents should be balanced when making zoning decisions?,"I don't really care what kind the residents are or what kind of future people I'm gonna get, assuming I'm gonna have this zoning thing. I don't really care. It just depends on the person. But, I mean specifically my neighborhood, right? I don't really care. That's it. But if a lot of people go, running your wash, eh, it'll be like a 50-50."
16,What role do you think social equity and access to opportunity play in discussions about zoning and housing policy?,"I don't know what that means, it relies on you."
17,"Would small changes in Higher density housing lead to noticeable changes in Support for Upzoning, or would it take larger shifts? Does it have a positive effect (increasing it) or a negative effect (decreasing it)? How strong is this effect?","I say both, I say both because when the zoning thing kicks in, right, you know, it's a brand new thing, right? So there'll be people, like, slowly just coming in and, like, they eventually will slowly build up. I don't even know what to say during that."
18,"What might lead to increases or decreases in Support for Upzoning, and how significant are these effects? Please also indicate if these influences are positive (increasing) or negative (decreasing).","I guess more people, uh, there'll be a lot more people coming in and how some of these effects, I don't know, depends on like where you're at, I don't know what's out of that."
19,How confident are you that changes in Crowding lead to changes in Support for Upzoning? Does it have a positive effect (increasing it) or a negative effect (decreasing it)? How strong is this effect?,"As for me, I guess maybe a little bit positive, but for everyone else, right, it depends. Like I said, I don't know if it's going to be a good thing or a bad thing for like, you know, the whole entirety of the USA."
20,How confident are you that changes in Neighborhood liveliness lead to changes in Support for Upzoning? Does it have a positive effect (increasing it) or a negative effect (decreasing it)? How strong is this effect?,"I say, I'm a little confident, I mean more people, right? More variety, more lively type, something like that. You know, it's nice to have more people, right? And you know, more people, be more social. That's a good thing. But I'm still a little confident, just a little bit. I'm not really confident, it's a teeny tiny bit. How strong they are, right? It depends."
21,"Would small changes in Crowdedness lead to noticeable changes in Support for Upzoning, or would it take larger shifts? Does it have a positive effect (increasing it) or a negative effect (decreasing it)? How strong is this effect?","I would say that it will take larger shifts because, you know, small changes that isn't really much Like small changes, that's just like what a couple of people, right? But that won't really make a difference. I would say like a uptick in of people As long as they affect Probably not that much"
22,How would you describe the relationship between Air quality and Support for Upzoning? Is it a strong or weak connection? Does it have a positive effect (increasing it) or a negative effect (decreasing it)? How strong is this effect?,"I'm in the middle of that, because you know, there's gonna be more people, more households around the upper zoning spot, so it kind of depends, uh, so uh, for like all three equations right, it just all depends, but specifically in my neighborhood, I'd say that it's maybe a little bit positive, uh, a little strong, yeah."
23,"Is the effect of Balancing approach (50-50) on Support for Upzoning immediate, or does it take time to develop? Does it have a positive effect (increasing it) or a negative effect (decreasing it)? How strong is this effect?","I say that it will take time for it to develop because like I said like when this when this episode then becomes a thing right you know depending where you're at it's gonna probably start slow maybe even faster, you're like out in New York but for me though I'd say that'd be a little bit slow and it'll probably take a little bit yeah it'll take some time but for everyone else maybe like uh uh I'd say it'll take a little a little more faster to develop than where I'm at"
24,"What factors affect Upzoning policies, and which ones have the strongest influence? Please also indicate if these influences are positive (increasing) or negative (decreasing).","Uh, I guess the people, you know, them, uh, the people, uh, uh, like, you know, very vocal, you know, Twitter and stuff, they may, uh, you know, might, you know, react over it, good or bad. Uh, maybe the president too. Um, uh, the local government, they might have, like, they might be affected to it. I guess it's like, it's where you're at. Like, if your government is like, I don't know, a good person or something, maybe that's a good thing. They might, you know, um, have some zoning policies and stuff. And if you're in like, I don't know, in a great state, you're probably just screwed. I don't know."
25,How confident are you that changes in Noticeable Changes in Support for Upzoning lead to changes in Support for Upzoning? Does it have a positive effect (increasing it) or a negative effect (decreasing it)? How strong is this effect?,"I don't even know what this means, to be honest."
26,"Would small changes in Positive Effect lead to noticeable changes in Support for Upzoning, or would it take larger shifts? Does it have a positive effect (increasing it) or a negative effect (decreasing it)? How strong is this effect?","I say that I would take larger shifts, depending on where you're at."
27,How confident are you that changes in Effect development over time lead to changes in Support for Upzoning? Does it have a positive effect (increasing it) or a negative effect (decreasing it)? How strong is this effect?,well like I said it depends well you know I think that the development the development the development were like oh can I be more restricted
28,"What factors affect Cost savings, and which ones have the strongest influence? Please also indicate if these influences are positive (increasing) or negative (decreasing).","Well, I think it's making the buildings themselves, that's like what, a million dollars? Obviously that would like influence the cost of the upzone, like, well, you need to make the buildings first, if you want, you know, the upzone in policy would be a thing, there's no buildings, right? No, the upzone in policy is kind of useless."
29,"Does Larger Shifts have a positive or negative effect on Support for Upzoning, and how significant is this effect? Does it have a positive effect (increasing it) or a negative effect (decreasing it)? How strong is this effect?","Well, I mean, it's also like making more buildings and allowing more people to be in like houses and stuff, probably depends on like, on the person, like if they have a big family, right, you know, maybe that's a, that's a good thing. A lot of shifts. Yeah, exactly. That depends on like, who's the family is, if there's like a big family, right, you know, maybe it's probably a positive or negative, depending on like what kind of house or building it is. It just depends, that's it."
30,"Is the effect of Negative Effect on Support for Upzoning immediate, or does it take time to develop? Does it have a positive effect (increasing it) or a negative effect (decreasing it)? How strong is this effect?",What does this mean?
31,"Does Strength of the effect have a positive or negative effect on Support for Upzoning, and how significant is this effect? Does it have a positive effect (increasing it) or a negative effect (decreasing it)? How strong is this effect?",uh well most of these questions are just like the answer is basically it depends this question it depends we don't know what's going to happen it depends on like the person the person itself they have a big family small family medium sized family a bunch of people little people people it just depends but i think uh for the uh majority of the people i say it's i'm gonna say neither positive nor negative i'm neutral about this
32,"Would small changes in Dependency of upzone on building presence lead to noticeable changes in Support for Upzoning, or would it take larger shifts? Does it have a positive effect (increasing it) or a negative effect (decreasing it)? How strong is this effect?","Okay, but for small changes, right? I think that's a positive thing. Cause there's gonna be, you know, just a little bit of people just ticking in into the up-zoning policy thing. More and more and more. And over time, it's gonna like, well, I think slowness is a good thing. Cause there's gonna be like ideas and policies that's gonna be developed. Cause if there's like an immediate uptick, you know, that's a bad thing. Cause you know, you haven't like, got your ideas like, you know, kicked in in your head before you actually execute it. So there's gonna be like a little people coming in, right? Now one by one, that's good. Cause then you have more time to, you know, get some ideas on what to do for the up-zoning thing. So yeah, small changes, that's a good thing. Yeah."
