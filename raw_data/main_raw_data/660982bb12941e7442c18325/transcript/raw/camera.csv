Question Number,Question,Answer
1,To what extent do you support or oppose the widespread deployment of surveillance cameras in public spaces? Please explain your reasoning.,"Uh, neither just because I really don't care about them, if they have them or don't, that's fine"
2,"What do you think are the most significant impacts, positive or negative, of increasing surveillance camera coverage in urban areas?","I think the most significant impact will be that sensitive cameras around, you know, public areas, right, or the urban areas, right. You know, it's like monitoring, you know, the areas 24-7. I think that's a good thing, right? So there'll be less crime and stuff. For negative, I think the only negative is that it might be misused, but I don't exactly know how it's going to be misused."
3,How do you think surveillance technologies might affect public safety and crime rates?,"I think that it will decrease crime rates by, you know, maybe like a little bit for our public safety. I think it will be a little bit better too."
4,What impact do you believe increased surveillance might have on personal privacy and individual liberties?,"You know what I mean, that depends on where the camera is, like there's no reason to like, you know, be invaded by your privacy, unless you're like, I don't know, masturbating in a public area, which you like, shouldn't even do in the first place. I mean like, other than having your face like, being on a camera, I don't really think your privacy has to be like, has to be a factor when it comes to like, having or not having cameras if they're like, used for safety and crime."
5,How do you think surveillance camera systems might affect community trust and police-community relations?,"I mean, I mean like, and cameras, uh, civilian cameras, security thing, like the whole entirety of the U.S. Like, no one cares about them. I don't care about them. If there's a camera, cool. Like, I'm being monitored. And, you know, there's OSHA monitoring other people too. That's good. Like, there's grinds being recorded. Um, I don't know."
6,What role do you believe government should play in regulating surveillance technologies and data collection?,"I ain't gonna lie with you, I don't know. Government, that's on them."
7,How might technological concerns about accuracy and reliability factor into decisions about surveillance systems?,"Uh, I guess how bad the camera quality is, like if it's really bad, I mean bad, um, it might have issues, like let's say if there was a crime that happened and they couldn't really tell, uh, they couldn't really, um, see their faces because the quality was pretty bad, so would it be really bad, it might like, um, you know, arrest a, arrest someone that wasn't part of that crime, so I think like having bad quality cameras might, uh, be concerned about accuracy and reliability."
8,"What economic effects, both positive and negative, might result from investing in widespread surveillance infrastructure?","I mean, aren't there already, like, a thing in the U.S. I don't think there's any, like, uh, like a comet effects, maybe a hard drive space, maybe, maybe that."
9,How do you think the interests of law enforcement versus privacy advocates should be balanced when making surveillance policy?,I guess depending on how bad the footage is I think uh I guess like if the footage like really bad like shouldn't even be seen in the public eye I think that should be uh only um owned by specialized people and not the law enforcement.
10,What role do you think social equity and potential bias play in discussions about surveillance technologies?,I don't even know what this means.
11,"What factors do you think influence Support for surveillance camera, and how strong is their impact? Please also indicate if these influences are positive (increasing) or negative (decreasing).",I don't think the support will influence anything if surveillance cameras were in the way of that. There's no factors.
12,"Is the effect of Monitoring public areas 24/7 on Support for surveillance camera immediate, or does it take time to develop? Does it have a positive effect (increasing it) or a negative effect (decreasing it)? How strong is this effect?","I think it's immediate. I mean, I don't think it's already a thing. I don't think it'll take time to develop. Like, yeah, it's already a thing. I think that has a positive effect too. Like, it's recording 24-7. You know, that's good."
13,"Does Crime Rates have a positive or negative effect on Support for surveillance camera, and how significant is this effect? Does it have a positive effect (increasing it) or a negative effect (decreasing it)? How strong is this effect?","I say that the crime rate should be a little bit low when there's cameras, I think that's a positive effect. I wouldn't really say it's pretty strong, but I say it's a little positive."
14,"Would small changes in Public Safety lead to noticeable changes in Support for surveillance camera, or would it take larger shifts? Does it have a positive effect (increasing it) or a negative effect (decreasing it)? How strong is this effect?","Um, small change in public safety. Not really, because it's small and no one's going to notice it. It's going to take time."
15,"Is the effect of Individual Liberties on Support for surveillance camera immediate, or does it take time to develop? Does it have a positive effect (increasing it) or a negative effect (decreasing it)? How strong is this effect?","I don't know what's an individual liberty even mean, can you be more specific?"
16,How confident are you that changes in Accuracy Concerns lead to changes in Support for surveillance camera? Does it have a positive effect (increasing it) or a negative effect (decreasing it)? How strong is this effect?,"I'm not really confident on those notices. No one cares about the accuracy concerns. I think, so I'm just neutral about this. Maybe if the camera quality is really bad, maybe that should be a concern about the accuracy. But if it's really high quality, I don't think that should be really a concern."
17,"Does Control over sensitive footage have a positive or negative effect on Support for surveillance camera, and how significant is this effect? Does it have a positive effect (increasing it) or a negative effect (decreasing it)? How strong is this effect?","I mean, yeah, I know I want to see like something really bad like something really illegal I think that should be only for like the the specialized people that know how to like, you know, what? Use the footage I don't know"
18,"Does Surveillance Cameras have a positive or negative effect on Support for surveillance camera, and how significant is this effect? Does it have a positive effect (increasing it) or a negative effect (decreasing it)? How strong is this effect?","What, what does this mean? Does civilian, civilian cameras have a, you're just saying the same thing. Does having cameras have a positive effect on cameras? I mean, yeah, cause like, you know. What? This is, what's this question? Um, yeah, it's positive. Yeah. Cameras, positive effect for cameras. Without a, without a camera, there would be no camera. So, uh, you need a camera, uh, to have, uh, support for a camera. What is this question? You're just saying the same thing. Yeah, positive effect. Yeah, really strong, cause like, it's a camera."
19,"Is the effect of Lack of influencing factors on Support for surveillance camera immediate, or does it take time to develop? Does it have a positive effect (increasing it) or a negative effect (decreasing it)? How strong is this effect?","Um, I don't really think there's a need here, nor does it take time for it to develop. Um, this is my first time knowing that there's factors for cameras. Um, I don't really think it's either immediate or it takes time to develop. It's just there. There's no effect."
20,How confident are you that changes in Immediate Effect lead to changes in Support for surveillance camera? Does it have a positive effect (increasing it) or a negative effect (decreasing it)? How strong is this effect?,"I don't think it will be anything to be honest, probably the same thing as like right now like whatever the Support for cameras right now. I don't think there's gonna be much of a difference"
21,How confident are you that changes in Positive Effect lead to changes in Support for surveillance camera? Does it have a positive effect (increasing it) or a negative effect (decreasing it)? How strong is this effect?,I say neither.
22,"Is the effect of Support for Surveillance Cameras on Support for surveillance camera immediate, or does it take time to develop? Does it have a positive effect (increasing it) or a negative effect (decreasing it)? How strong is this effect?","Um, is there a fight of support for civilian cameras on support for civilians? Um, yeah, I think it would be positive, but not by much. What is this question? Is this the same? Okay."
23,"What factors do you think influence Increased surveillance camera coverage, and how strong is their impact? Please also indicate if these influences are positive (increasing) or negative (decreasing).","I guess with the price of having the footage, like you need a bunch of hard drives to keep the footage. So I think the price was just a native thing, but I think all the positives over why it's negative like having more security over the public, less crime rates maybe, just more safety that's really it."
24,"Is the effect of Specialized access on Support for surveillance camera immediate, or does it take time to develop? Does it have a positive effect (increasing it) or a negative effect (decreasing it)? How strong is this effect?","Uh, I mean, I guess develop, cause like you need people who be in the specialized axis probably. And, you know, it'll take time to us. So to build up a community of a bunch of specialized people, uh, and camera footage and stuff. Let's see if the skill fact isn't really that strong."
25,How confident are you that changes in Strength of Effect lead to changes in Support for surveillance camera? Does it have a positive effect (increasing it) or a negative effect (decreasing it)? How strong is this effect?,I say neither.
26,"Would small changes in Current Level of Support for Cameras lead to noticeable changes in Support for surveillance camera, or would it take larger shifts? Does it have a positive effect (increasing it) or a negative effect (decreasing it)? How strong is this effect?","Um, no, not really. I think it will take a while. No one's gonna notice it. Besides, um, I don't know, I guess the local government. Um, yeah, and maybe Twitter, I don't know."
27,"Is the effect of Neutral Stance on Support for surveillance camera immediate, or does it take time to develop? Does it have a positive effect (increasing it) or a negative effect (decreasing it)? How strong is this effect?","Same question as last time, I'm gonna, uh, yeah this is the same question but it says neutral. Um, I think I'm gonna say, um, uh, the same answer as my last one."
28,How would you describe the relationship between Increased security and Support for surveillance camera? Is it a strong or weak connection? Does it have a positive effect (increasing it) or a negative effect (decreasing it)? How strong is this effect?,"I'd say that it's pretty strong, because, you know, without cameras, there's no security. You need both of them to have a safe environment, and I think that it's positive, and it's pretty strong too."
