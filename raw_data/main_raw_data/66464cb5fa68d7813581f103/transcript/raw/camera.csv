Question Number,Question,Answer
1,To what extent do you support or oppose the widespread deployment of surveillance cameras in public spaces? Please explain your reasoning.,"I am somewhat in favor of the deployment of surveillance cameras. As much as I feel like it's a slight invasion of privacy, it's also very important I would argue more important for people to feel safer and for there to be less crime."
2,"What do you think are the most significant impacts, positive or negative, of increasing surveillance camera coverage in urban areas?",The most significant impact would undoubtedly be a decrease in crime rate in urban areas thanks to these surveillance cameras.
3,How do you think surveillance technologies might affect public safety and crime rates?,I think they would have a positive effect on crime rates and would make the public at large feel more safe.
4,What impact do you believe increased surveillance might have on personal privacy and individual liberties?,"I believe that these cameras in these public spaces are an invasion of privacy, however, one has to weigh the positives and negatives, and whether it's worth trading personal privacy for safety."
5,How do you think surveillance camera systems might affect community trust and police-community relations?,"As long as these surveillance systems are used for good, I don't see why people would be opposed to them. As long as crime rates see a decrease, I believe it would build more trust in the police and these surveillance systems."
6,What role do you believe government should play in regulating surveillance technologies and data collection?,"I believe there should be rules on how long data is stored for, who has access to this data, and I believe that the public has a right to see this data at any time."
7,How might technological concerns about accuracy and reliability factor into decisions about surveillance systems?,I think that reliability in the sense that these systems don't have any kind of malfunctions or loopholes that would-be criminals can find loopholes around to commit crime or to abuse the surveillance systems.
8,"What economic effects, both positive and negative, might result from investing in widespread surveillance infrastructure?","I believe that investing in the surveillance infrastructure would end up having positive effects on the local economy. The reason for that is neighborhoods feeling safer, businesses being safer, not having to worry so much about crime, would not only be good for public confidence but it would be good for business as well."
9,How do you think the interests of law enforcement versus privacy advocates should be balanced when making surveillance policy?,"I believe that this in particular is a very sensitive issue and has to be tackled with the right amount of precision. If surveillance systems are going to be implemented in public spaces, we have to determine which public spaces are necessary to be surveyed and to make sure that these systems don't cause an overreach of an invasion of privacy, i.e. we don't want them in spaces such as bathrooms, in spaces that allow us to look into people's homes. There has to be a hard limit on how much can be allowed to be surveyed."
10,What role do you think social equity and potential bias play in discussions about surveillance technologies?,I don't believe they play any role.
11,"Is the effect of Feeling safe on Support for surveillance camera immediate, or does it take time to develop? Does it have a positive effect (increasing it) or a negative effect (decreasing it)? How strong is this effect?","You might believe that the effect of feeling safe will take time to develop. Once people start seeing a reduction in crime, it will no doubt have a positive effect and increase support for the systems."
12,"What factors affect Support for surveillance camera, and which ones have the strongest influence? Please also indicate if these influences are positive (increasing) or negative (decreasing).",Ultimately I believe that safety is the most important factor in support for these surveillance systems. As I said earlier there will be concerns about privacy but at the end of the day I believe that people will be willing to trade civil liberties to feel safer.
13,"Would small changes in Decrease in crime rate lead to noticeable changes in Support for surveillance camera, or would it take larger shifts? Does it have a positive effect (increasing it) or a negative effect (decreasing it)? How strong is this effect?","I think small changes in the decrease of crime rate will lead to support, but it's going to take a larger shift for the support to be more widespread. Once people start seeing less crime, support will undoubtedly increase."
14,"Does Crime Rates have a positive or negative effect on Support for surveillance camera, and how significant is this effect? Does it have a positive effect (increasing it) or a negative effect (decreasing it)? How strong is this effect?","Crime rates will ultimately be the most important factor in whether people support these surveillance systems or not. If there's no decrease in the rate of crime in these areas, support for these systems may decrease because at that point people are being watched for no good reason. If crime rates go down, as they should, there will undoubtedly be support for these systems in a big way."
15,"Is the effect of Personal privacy on Support for surveillance camera immediate, or does it take time to develop? Does it have a positive effect (increasing it) or a negative effect (decreasing it)? How strong is this effect?","I think the effect is going to take time to develop. The effect of personal privacy is one that's going to take time to determine whether it will or won't be an issue for the public. If these surveillance systems end up being used in corrupt or mischievous ways, then people will lose faith in these systems and will start to oppose them."
16,How would you describe the relationship between Crime rate reduction and Support for surveillance camera? Is it a strong or weak connection? Does it have a positive effect (increasing it) or a negative effect (decreasing it)? How strong is this effect?,"A reduction in crime will undoubtedly support, or rather will undoubtedly increase support for these systems. It's a strong connection, perhaps the strongest connection, for why anybody would be in favor of these systems in the first place."
17,How confident are you that changes in Public transparency lead to changes in Support for surveillance camera? Does it have a positive effect (increasing it) or a negative effect (decreasing it)? How strong is this effect?,I believe that transparency is a key factor in whether or not people will support these surveillance systems. People might not mind being watched if they knew how their data would be used. There should be a way for the public to have access to this data to make sure that it's not being mishandled or misused.
18,How confident are you that changes in Malfunctions in surveillance systems lead to changes in Support for surveillance camera? Does it have a positive effect (increasing it) or a negative effect (decreasing it)? How strong is this effect?,"Malfunction in these surveillance systems will undoubtedly have a negative effect on support for these surveillance systems. It's extremely important that these systems work as intended and when they are needed most. What good are these systems if they're not functioning? When a crime is being committed, for instance."
19,"Is the effect of Public confidence on Support for surveillance camera immediate, or does it take time to develop? Does it have a positive effect (increasing it) or a negative effect (decreasing it)? How strong is this effect?","I believe the effect of public confidence will take time to develop. Once people see a reduction in crime rate, once people feel safer, confidence will undoubtedly increase, thus increasing support for these surveillance systems."
20,"Would small changes in Privacy protection lead to noticeable changes in Support for surveillance camera, or would it take larger shifts? Does it have a positive effect (increasing it) or a negative effect (decreasing it)? How strong is this effect?","I think it would take larger shifts of privacy protections to cause noticeable changes in support. As I said earlier, it's important that people feel that their data isn't being misused or mishandled in a way that these surveillance systems weren't intended to be used for. Any of these privacy changes must be clearly and directly communicated with the communities affected by these changes or else you will see less and less support in general."
21,"Would small changes in Positive effect lead to noticeable changes in Support for surveillance camera, or would it take larger shifts? Does it have a positive effect (increasing it) or a negative effect (decreasing it)? How strong is this effect?","Small changes in positive effects would be good, but larger shifts are going to be necessary to cause any kind of change, good or bad, in support for these surveillance systems. The larger the positive effects, the more support you'll get."
22,How confident are you that changes in Privacy concerns lead to changes in Support for surveillance camera? Does it have a positive effect (increasing it) or a negative effect (decreasing it)? How strong is this effect?,"As stated earlier, any sort of change in privacy concerns will undoubtedly have an effect on support for surveillance systems. If these changes infringe on people's privacy further than necessary, or in a way that makes people feel less safe, then that will undoubtedly have a negative effect on support for these systems. It's important to make sure that any of these changes are handled with care, and in a way that the community can be ensured these changes are for the better."
23,"What might lead to increases or decreases in Surveillance cameras, and how significant are these effects? Please also indicate if these influences are positive (increasing) or negative (decreasing).","I think areas with more crime will need an increase in surveillance cameras. Areas with less crime, in theory, shouldn't need as many cameras. The effects of these cameras should undoubtedly affect the rate of crime in the areas they are put. If the crime rate decreases, then it's safe to say these changes are positive. If additional cameras does not lead to less crime, then these changes will be seen as negative."
24,"Is the effect of Support for surveillance cameras on Support for surveillance camera immediate, or does it take time to develop? Does it have a positive effect (increasing it) or a negative effect (decreasing it)? How strong is this effect?","I believe that it will take time for the support of surveillance cameras in these areas to develop. Only when people start seeing noticeable changes in the rate of crime will there be an equally great reaction. An increase in crime rate, for instance, would cause opposition to these changes, but a decrease in crime rate will, in my opinion, only increase support."
25,"What factors affect Surveillance Technologies, and which ones have the strongest influence? Please also indicate if these influences are positive (increasing) or negative (decreasing).","The biggest factors, in my opinion, are how these technologies will be used. The people or agencies involved in how this tech is used, will determine whether they are used for good purposes or bad."
26,"What factors do you think influence Increased surveillance, and how strong is their impact? Please also indicate if these influences are positive (increasing) or negative (decreasing).",I think that higher crime rates cause a need for increased surveillance and that lower crime rates shouldn't require additional surveillance. Areas with higher rates of crime may need increased surveillance in order to deter crimes from taking place to begin with.
27,What causes changes in Surveillance camera systems? Are these influences strong or weak?,"I believe that the people in charge of the surveillance technologies would be the ones to cause changes, whether that's new technology forms being available or whether that's finding good and or bad ways of using these systems. And I believe they have a strong effect."
