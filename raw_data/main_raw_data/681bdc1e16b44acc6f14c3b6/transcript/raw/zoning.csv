6,Excellent! We're now ready to begin the interview about urban zoning policies. Take your time with each response and provide as much detail as you'd like. Let's start with our first question.,OK.
7,To what extent do you support or oppose upzoning policies that allow for higher density housing in traditionally single-family neighborhoods? Please explain your reasoning.,"I support it greatly because it creates room for cheaper housing, giving other people opportunities to have houses. It also eases the pressure on the housing and support the businesses, local businesses thrive because of the traffic."
8,"What do you think are the most significant impacts, positive or negative, of increasing housing density in residential neighborhoods?","And part of the positive is definitely traffic means business. So there are lots of businesses in there. There'll be lots of local businesses routing within their locality, because there'll be a lot of people living around. And two, I would say, on the other negative, which is not really a major factor right now, the higher traffic might bring in the human and the car traffic, and a couple of a few criminal activities."
9,How do you think upzoning policies might affect housing affordability in urban areas?,it will affect it to the positive a great deal because the houses will be affordable.
10,What impact do you believe increased housing density might have on neighborhood character and quality of life?,"There will be cross-mixing, cross-matching, because definitely there will be bad people coming around. But again, the positive of it is that there will be other good people coming around. The increased traffic will bring in more infrastructure, more businesses, more schools into the area."
11,How do you think upzoning might affect transportation systems and traffic congestion in cities?,"There will be a lot of traffic, congestion, because the already available traffic system only factored in the current system, but now up, up, up, zoning would mean that there'll be more people, there'll be a lot of pressure on the traffic."
12,What role do you believe local government should play in regulating housing development and density?,"They should by increasing more infrastructure, factoring in the pressure and coming up with policies and regulations."

14,"What economic effects, both positive and negative, might result from changing zoning laws to allow more multi-family housing?","The positive is that the pressure, the congestion, the people coming around will boost the economic activities in the region. There will be a lot of business sprouting. So it's on the positive, yes."
15,How do you think the interests of current residents versus future residents should be balanced when making zoning decisions?,"should strike a balance in that they need to be made aware of why that has to happen, that the interest they are catered for, the status quo, nothing changes, they still maintain the status and the services. At the same time, those coming in must also be elevated to that level and be given the systems of that zone."
