Question Number,Question,Answer
1,To what extent do you support or oppose universal healthcare policies that provide government-funded healthcare coverage for all citizens? Please explain your reasoning.,I support universal health care policies. I think that government-funded health care coverage for all citizens feels like the right thing in the current state our country is in.

8,"What economic effects, both positive and negative, might result from transitioning to a universal healthcare system?","If there was a minimum or a ceiling where someone making over $190,000 gets universal healthcare, I cannot imagine it would have a negative economic effect. I do not believe that millionaires should get free healthcare, but if you're making over $200,000 a year, you can afford it."
9,How do you think the interests of taxpayers versus healthcare consumers should be balanced when making healthcare policy?,"I think the interests of taxpayers versus health care consumers should be balanced.

People who live under the poverty line, people who are socially and economically at a disproportionate level below lower middle class are the ones who need the help the most."

I think medical innovation might need time to develop, but the effect in the long run would be positive, and it would be a strong effect."
