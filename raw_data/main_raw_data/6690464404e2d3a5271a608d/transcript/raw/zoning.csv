6,Excellent! We're now ready to begin the interview about urban zoning policies. Take your time with each response and provide as much detail as you'd like. Let's start with our first question.,"Okay, I'm ready."
7,To what extent do you support or oppose upzoning policies that allow for higher density housing in traditionally single-family neighborhoods? Please explain your reasoning.,"For the most part, I support upzoning policies. I came from Southern California, which did not have enough housing and the prices were through the roof. Our current town has a lot of open space, so I could see upzoning to create tall apartment buildings being a great solution to provide lower income and middle class families opportunities to purchase or live in nicer neighborhoods."
8,"What do you think are the most significant impacts, positive or negative, of increasing housing density in residential neighborhoods?",I think the impact is significantly positive if we can increase housing in residential areas that have space to do so. 
9,How do you think upzoning policies might affect housing affordability in urban areas?,"I think the most significant impact would be traffic and bringing house prices down. I think that upzoning policies would definitely affect the affordability in the area I live, which is more suburban."
10,What impact do you believe increased housing density might have on neighborhood character and quality of life?,"Currently, the neighborhood I live in is mainly single family homes, but three blocks away they put in four story apartments and it changed the look a little bit, but you could tell the developer tried to keep it the same style, but only traffic and an additional stop sign is the difference I can see in the quality of life."
11,How do you think upzoning might affect transportation systems and traffic congestion in cities?,"When I first moved to this neighborhood, we didn't have as many stoplights and stop signs. And now that the apartment building and the new school is up and running, that would be an area in the transportation system that I've noticed. I don't think it has more congestion because it is running smoother now with the addition of the stoplight."
12,What role do you believe local government should play in regulating housing development and density?,I think local government plays a huge role in the development. I think that they are on top of the pulse of how many people in town are without homes and need more lower income and middle income opportunities.
13,How might environmental concerns factor into decisions about urban density and zoning?,"I think environmental concerns are a big factor. Our neighborhood, for example, has cows that were dispersed when this neighborhood was built. We have a once a year insect explosion that happens because most houses weren't in existence in this area a few years ago and those insects need somewhere to go. "
14,"What economic effects, both positive and negative, might result from changing zoning laws to allow more multi-family housing?","The economic effects from changing zoning laws to allow for multifamily housing definitely has positives and negatives. I think the positive is it brings a more diverse culture to your neighborhood. Negative is some people might think their home values might go down, but in this current market where housing is through the roof, I think we could do for a little settling of how expensive housing prices are."
15,How do you think the interests of current residents versus future residents should be balanced when making zoning decisions?,"I think the interests of the current residents have already been taken into account. If you buy a house and you have a mortgage, I don't necessarily think your interests are as important as people who can't afford to buy a house. I think the people who need homes and need to find housing that is safe and appropriate for their children needs to be more important than the current interests of the residents that already have homes."
16,What role do you think social equity and access to opportunity play in discussions about zoning and housing policy?,I think this is hugely important. Social equity and access to housing is so important. There are too many people that are pushed out of the housing market because the prices are too high and the interest rates have skyrocketed. I think that the discussions need to be centered around how can we make sure anyone who wants to buy a house can buy a house or an apartment.
17,How confident are you that changes in High housing prices lead to changes in Support for Upzoning? Does it have a positive effect (increasing it) or a negative effect (decreasing it)? How strong is this effect?,"My confidence level is medium. I think having a upzoning is an option for creating some change, but I think more change needs to happen. And it can't just happen in lower and middle class neighborhoods. It needs to be happening in all neighborhoods or else it feels unbalanced. Because there is positive effects, but there's also negative effects. Because like mentioned before, you have more traffic and more resources being used."
18,"What factors do you think influence Support for Upzoning, and how strong is their impact? Please also indicate if these influences are positive (increasing) or negative (decreasing).","I think the factors that support upzoning are people who want to get into the market, who want their kids to go to good schools. So if there's opportunities with condos or apartment buildings that are building up, that creates a positive change because everyone deserves to send their kids to a good school."
19,"Is the effect of House prices on Support for Upzoning immediate, or does it take time to develop? Does it have a positive effect (increasing it) or a negative effect (decreasing it)? How strong is this effect?","I think it takes time to develop. I know in our neighborhood when the apartments went up there was some concern, but I think that overall the positive effect supersedes any negative effects."
20,How confident are you that changes in Four-story apartments lead to changes in Support for Upzoning? Does it have a positive effect (increasing it) or a negative effect (decreasing it)? How strong is this effect?,"I'm semi-confident that for a four-story apartment would lead to changes and support for upzoning. I think the support is coming from outside the area, not necessarily current residents. I think it has positive effect because it brings people into your neighborhood that might not necessarily be able to afford it. And there is the negative effect of traffic and congestion and resources being used. And the effect is going to be strong on both sides."
21,How would you describe the relationship between Transportation Systems and Support for Upzoning? Is it a strong or weak connection? Does it have a positive effect (increasing it) or a negative effect (decreasing it)? How strong is this effect?,"In an ideal world, the local government would make sure the relationship between transportation systems and support for upzoning would work together. Like I mentioned earlier, when our three or four story apartments went up around the corner, we had to have a new stop sign put in, we needed a new stoplight to be put in, because there was more traffic."
22,"Is the effect of Neighborhood Development on Support for Upzoning immediate, or does it take time to develop? Does it have a positive effect (increasing it) or a negative effect (decreasing it)? How strong is this effect?",I think the effect of neighborhood development for supporting the upzoning took quite a while to develop. I don't think it was immediate. I think current homeowners probably saw it as a negative and the question of how strong is this effect is pretty strong. People were very concerned.
23,"Would small changes in Housing development lead to noticeable changes in Support for Upzoning, or would it take larger shifts? Does it have a positive effect (increasing it) or a negative effect (decreasing it)? How strong is this effect?","I think small changes are great, but big changes make a bigger difference. If you're going to support upzoning, you need to be able to support it with more schools, more grocery stores, more gas stations. So small changes seems like it moves too slowly. For that positive effect to increase, you need to see the changes moving a little faster and bigger."
24,"Is the effect of Urban density on Support for Upzoning immediate, or does it take time to develop? Does it have a positive effect (increasing it) or a negative effect (decreasing it)? How strong is this effect?","I think the urban density support for upzoning is over time to develop the support. I think that there is both positive effects and negative effects. For example, we just got our first gas station on this side of town and that's a positive effect, but waiting for it was negative."
25,How would you describe the relationship between Diverse Culture and Support for Upzoning? Is it a strong or weak connection? Does it have a positive effect (increasing it) or a negative effect (decreasing it)? How strong is this effect?,"I think there is a relationship between diverse culture and support for upzoning. I think that it's important for people to recognize that that connection is strong and we need to recognize that not everyone is going to look the same or have the same economic, socioeconomic similarities, that our differences are what bring us together and the effect of that is very strong."
26,How would you describe the relationship between Future residents' needs and Support for Upzoning? Is it a strong or weak connection? Does it have a positive effect (increasing it) or a negative effect (decreasing it)? How strong is this effect?,"How would I describe the relationship between future residents' needs and support for upzoning? I think the connection is strong there. I think when you consider future residents, they're going to need the infrastructure, be able to driving back and forth. I think you're going to need schools for families and that support for upzoning is going to come in because people who want to live in certain neighborhoods are going to support upzoning. I think the connection is strong. I think it would have a positive effect because when you bring families into neighborhoods, that's a positive effect."
27,"Would small changes in Affordability of housing lead to noticeable changes in Support for Upzoning, or would it take larger shifts? Does it have a positive effect (increasing it) or a negative effect (decreasing it)? How strong is this effect?","I don't believe that small changes in affordability of housing would lead to noticeable changes in support for upzoning. I think that the current housing market is out of reach for a large population of people. Even the middle class can't get into the housing market. So it requires these larger shifts. And does it have a positive or negative effect? Well, I think it all depends on the changes. Is it a small affordability of housing change or a large?"
28,"Does Social Equity have a positive or negative effect on Support for Upzoning, and how significant is this effect? Does it have a positive effect (increasing it) or a negative effect (decreasing it)? How strong is this effect?","I think in this day and age, in 2025, social equity needs to have a positive effect that all of us should be supporting upzoning so that all people, families, individuals who want to be able to live in certain areas, that the local government will make it possible. I think this would have a positive effect and I think it would be strong."
29,"Does Access to Opportunity have a positive or negative effect on Support for Upzoning, and how significant is this effect? Does it have a positive effect (increasing it) or a negative effect (decreasing it)? How strong is this effect?",Does access to opportunity have a positive or negative effect for support for upzoning? I believe it has a positive effect. And I think it's significant because the effect being positive is strong when you think about wanting to support people getting into housing.
30,What causes changes in Housing shortage? Are these influences strong or weak?,"The changes in housing shortage is both strong and weak. In a very expensive area, it is hugely a strong influence on people's lives because if you can't find housing you can afford, you're put in positions that you shouldn't be in. Everyone should be able to find housing that's within their cost of living."
31,"Does Good schools have a positive or negative effect on Support for Upzoning, and how significant is this effect? Does it have a positive effect (increasing it) or a negative effect (decreasing it)? How strong is this effect?","I think good schools have a very positive effect on the support for upzoning. When you see a school with great scores and a reputation and there's land near it, it's only natural for people to want to have more housing in that area so families can send their kids there. I think it's a very strong effect."
32,"Would small changes in Condos or apartment buildings lead to noticeable changes in Support for Upzoning, or would it take larger shifts? Does it have a positive effect (increasing it) or a negative effect (decreasing it)? How strong is this effect?",I think small changes in condos or apartment buildings would lead to noticeable changes in support for upzoning. It's very rare that condos and apartment buildings are built in towns that are more residential like the suburbs. So I think it would have a positive effect and I do think it would be strong.
