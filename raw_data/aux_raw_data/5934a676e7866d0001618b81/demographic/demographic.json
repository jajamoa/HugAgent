    "housing_experience": "I moved from Green Bay about 50 miles north to Marinette in June 2023. I had been sharing a modest ranch-style house with a married couple who are close friends of mine. Now I share a big two-story house with a friend. I mostly live upstairs and we share the downstairs kitchen and laundry area. The spouses I'd been living with were fighting a lot and it had become very unpleasant. I moved here because I couldn't afford my own place, and it was very tough to find a roommate at my age (64 at the time).",
