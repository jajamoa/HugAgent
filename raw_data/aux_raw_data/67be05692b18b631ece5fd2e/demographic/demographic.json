    "housing_experience": "I rented a small apartment for the past five years, but my rent kept going up. I had to move last year to a cheaper place farther from work to save money. My old apartment raised the rent by 15% last year, which was more than I could afford. This was the main reason I had to move. It's been tough with longer commutes and fewer amenities.",
