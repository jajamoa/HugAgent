    "housing_experience": "Four years ago we moved from a typical midwestern suburban home in a subdivision to a condominium complex.  The condos are attached two and three story buildings in a unit collection intended to resemble an Italian village.  The buildings are loosely circled around a large swimming pool and a fountain (this is in Florida).  This was quite a change for my husband and I, who both grew up in a very suburban environment outside of a large midwestern city.  We were not used to certain aspects of the situation, such as the close proximity to neighbors, no real exterior space of our own, and exorbitant HOA costs.  We have mostly adjusted and settled in, but there was some culture shock.",
