    "housing_experience": "I've actually moved a couple of times in the last few years. The first move was because my old place was getting really expensive, and I wasn't getting as much space as I wanted. I ended up finding a slightly smaller place, but the rent was way better, and it was in a much better location for me.\n\nThen, a couple of years later, I moved again, this time because I got a new job in a different city. I had to find a place pretty quickly, so I ended up renting an apartment. It was a bit of a hassle at first, but it's been working out okay.",
