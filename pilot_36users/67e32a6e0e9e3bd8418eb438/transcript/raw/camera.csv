Question Number,Question,Answer
1,To what extent do you support or oppose the widespread deployment of surveillance cameras in public spaces? Please explain your reasoning.,I support. We need evidence when serious crime cases happen.
2,"What do you think are the most significant impacts, positive or negative, of increasing surveillance camera coverage in urban areas?","The most significant impact of increasing cameras is reduced crime. On the downside, there are privacy concerns."
3,How do you think surveillance technologies might affect public safety and crime rates?,"I am confident that more cameras dissuade wrongdoers from engaging in criminal activities, ensuring public safety."
4,What impact do you believe increased surveillance might have on personal privacy and individual liberties?,"There are those who may complain because cameras record everything. So, there may be discomfort when privacy is significantly infringed."
5,How do you think surveillance camera systems might affect community trust and police-community relations?,"When criminals are unveiled through recorded video clips, I think people would believe more in policing, substantially improving police-community relations."
6,What role do you believe government should play in regulating surveillance technologies and data collection?,The government's role is to ensure transparency and prevent abuse of this technology.
7,How might technological concerns about accuracy and reliability factor into decisions about surveillance systems?,"These concerns have a lot of weight since they can make or break public trust. Wrongful accusations may arise when the system is prone to false positives, eroding public trust."
8,"What economic effects, both positive and negative, might result from investing in widespread surveillance infrastructure?",Crime reduction and deterrence are the main positive effects. Investors are more confident to engage in business when they are sure that their premises will not be attacked.
9,How do you think the interests of law enforcement versus privacy advocates should be balanced when making surveillance policy?,"Policies should be enacted to ensure accountability, transparency, and clear legal standards. Examples include enforcing robust data protection measures and mandating judicial oversight for specific types of surveillance."
10,What role do you think social equity and potential bias play in discussions about surveillance technologies?,"I think there may be reasons to worry about discrimination. However, I strongly support the technology because images and videos clearly identify the perpetrators."
11,"Does Need for evidence in crime cases have a positive or negative effect on Support for surveillance camera, and how significant is this effect? Does it have a positive effect (increasing it) or a negative effect (decreasing it)? How strong is this effect?",The need for surveillance increases the support for CCTV cameras because they provide objective evidence. The effect is very strong here.
12,"What do you think are the main causes of Support for surveillance camera, and how certain are you about these relationships? Please also indicate if these influences are positive (increasing) or negative (decreasing).","The main cause of support for CCTV is the sense of security and possibility of identifying crime perpetrators. The influence here is very strong. The main cause of opposition for CCTV is privacy concerns, which is not a strong effect since we live in a tech-dominated world where nobody can claim to have privacy."
13,"Is the effect of Deterrence Effect on Support for surveillance camera immediate, or does it take time to develop? Does it have a positive effect (increasing it) or a negative effect (decreasing it)? How strong is this effect?","The deterrence effect builds support for CCTVs over time, not immediately. It takes time for communities to appreciate the value of these cameras. The effect here increases as more crime cases are solved with the help of CCTVs. The effect here is strong."
14,"Does Personal privacy have a positive or negative effect on Support for surveillance camera, and how significant is this effect? Does it have a positive effect (increasing it) or a negative effect (decreasing it)? How strong is this effect?","Personal privacy also impacts the level of support for CCTVs. However, this effect is not as strong as security since people are used to living in a privacy-less world."
15,How would you describe the relationship between Belief in Policing and Support for surveillance camera? Is it a strong or weak connection? Does it have a positive effect (increasing it) or a negative effect (decreasing it)? How strong is this effect?,This relationship is strong because most people people appreciate the police when cases are solved conclusively and credibly. The effect here is strong.
16,"Would small changes in Transparency lead to noticeable changes in Support for surveillance camera, or would it take larger shifts? Does it have a positive effect (increasing it) or a negative effect (decreasing it)? How strong is this effect?","Changes in transparency can translate into more support for CCTVs, but the impact is gradual. The effect here is moderate."
17,"Is the effect of Prevent abuse on Support for surveillance camera immediate, or does it take time to develop? Does it have a positive effect (increasing it) or a negative effect (decreasing it)? How strong is this effect?","Preventing abuse builds more confidence in CCTVs, but the support is gradual. People belief more in this technology when they are reassured that no one can manipulate it. The effect here is strong."
18,"Is the effect of Reliability on Support for surveillance camera immediate, or does it take time to develop? Does it have a positive effect (increasing it) or a negative effect (decreasing it)? How strong is this effect?",The effect here is strong and immediate because public trust increases when this technology is capable of collecting accurate and dependable footage. Definitely positive effect.
19,How would you describe the relationship between Public Trust and Support for surveillance camera? Is it a strong or weak connection? Does it have a positive effect (increasing it) or a negative effect (decreasing it)? How strong is this effect?,This relationship is strong and positive because more people are receptive of this technology when it is proven to work.
20,How would you describe the relationship between Deterrence and Support for surveillance camera? Is it a strong or weak connection? Does it have a positive effect (increasing it) or a negative effect (decreasing it)? How strong is this effect?,The relationship is also strong and positive because more people associate CCTVs with reduced criminal activity.
21,How confident are you that changes in Discrimination Concerns lead to changes in Support for surveillance camera? Does it have a positive effect (increasing it) or a negative effect (decreasing it)? How strong is this effect?,"Although these issues are considered important, I think they are insignificant in the sense that a perpetrator caught on camera cannot blame it on being from a minority group. The effect here is weak since most people want the real perpetrators to be brought to book no matter their background."
22,How confident are you that changes in Support for Surveillance Technology lead to changes in Support for surveillance camera? Does it have a positive effect (increasing it) or a negative effect (decreasing it)? How strong is this effect?,"I think they are the same thing. Surveillance means using cameras to capture proceedings in real-time. This effect is strong because when surveillance is acceptable in society, people develop a positive attitude toward cameras."
23,What causes changes in Support for surveillance cameras? Are these influences strong or weak?,"The main dynamics are security and privacy, both of which are strong influences."
24,"Would small changes in Privacy concerns lead to noticeable changes in Support for surveillance camera, or would it take larger shifts? Does it have a positive effect (increasing it) or a negative effect (decreasing it)? How strong is this effect?","I think changes in privacy does not affect much the support for surveillance cameras since the modern generation is used to living under these conditions. The change is gradual, not immediate. The effect here is weak."
25,"Does Positive Effect have a positive or negative effect on Support for surveillance camera, and how significant is this effect? Does it have a positive effect (increasing it) or a negative effect (decreasing it)? How strong is this effect?","The public approval means positive effect and increased support for CCTVs. The effect is strong, especially when people witness the benefits of this technology in crime reduction and deterrence."
