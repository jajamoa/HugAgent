    "housing_experience": "About 4 years ago, my wife and I finally bought our first home here in Wedgwood after years of renting in Ballard. We'd been saving aggressively because we wanted more space for our family. Our old apartment just wasn't cutting it anymore. The mortgage process was brutal (Seattle prices, right?), but we got lucky with a modest 3-bedroom rambler that needed some work. Before that, I was renting an apartment in a nearby neighborhood. The main reason for the move was wanting something more permanent and building equity instead of continuing to rent.",
