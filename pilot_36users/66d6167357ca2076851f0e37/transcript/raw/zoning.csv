6,Excellent! We're now ready to begin the interview about urban zoning policies. Take your time with each response and provide as much detail as you'd like. Let's start with our first question.,I am ready.
7,To what extent do you support or oppose upzoning policies that allow for higher density housing in traditionally single-family neighborhoods? Please explain your reasoning.,I honestly think it's not a bad idea. I think it can be helpful for certain communities especially let's say if your rent is higher. I honestly think if there's more density to a neighborhood it could lower your rent or have a better community for you and your family.
8,"What do you think are the most significant impacts, positive or negative, of increasing housing density in residential neighborhoods?",I think the most significant impacts would probably be the pricing and also how safe your neighborhood is at that point and also what kind of traffic will start going through there and how loud your houses or slash neighbors will be.
9,How do you think upzoning policies might affect housing affordability in urban areas?,"I think it can affect just the overall landscaping section of the neighborhoods because I think if you have a certain amount of people in a neighborhood or let's say, for example, if you have more than enough people in the neighborhood, it can definitely raise the prices because there's a lot more resources to be made out there."
10,What impact do you believe increased housing density might have on neighborhood character and quality of life?,"Overall, I think what increases the housing density the most would just be the people in general, and the housing that gets built and then I also think, just like I said in the previous paragraph, that, you know, like the resources now will be a lot more and you have to use a lot more resources, especially with a bunch more people in your neighborhood. I also believe that once there's a certain amount of people that's in your neighborhood, well then you have to look at the, like your sewer systems and your plumbing systems and see how much more you have to spend, because you're gonna have to either have a septic system in place or you're gonna have to figure out what kind of community sewer system you're going to be running through."
11,How do you think upzoning might affect transportation systems and traffic congestion in cities?,"Again, I think it will affect the traffic congestion in cities just because about the more people there, which means there's gonna be more cars and more jobs. So there's gonna be a lot more roads that are gonna be more busy."
12,What role do you believe local government should play in regulating housing development and density?,I think the role that the government should probably play would be to have the housing probably spaced out and in a certain way where you're not congested and having a bunch of lines or like a bunch of just Crowded people
13,How might environmental concerns factor into decisions about urban density and zoning?,So the environmental concerns that I would say would be definitely the water system and if I would also say the plants and trees I would think that there's gonna be a lot more trees planted and more seeds planted because there's more people which means more houses which means more cars which means more carbon emissions so I kind of think it all lines up to to be more of a concern in the environment just for the fact of nature.
14,"What economic effects, both positive and negative, might result from changing zoning laws to allow more multi-family housing?",the like the so the economic effects would definitely be that the positive side would be more people which means more community and also means more job opportunities which means like more money would be flown in to your neighborhood which can make a better community but then on the negative side I mean like I said in the previous paragraphs it'd be crowded you would have a lot more cars on the streets you'd be like it'd be a lot more loud probably as well in your neighborhood and I also believe there'd be a lot more carbon emissions more carbon footprints as well
15,How do you think the interests of current residents versus future residents should be balanced when making zoning decisions?,"I believe for your current residence there should be a zone where where you have a specific amount of stuff for you and your family that's already put in place and then for future for future people I Kind of think that they need to build their own environments Kind of as well with their family, and I kind of think That they'd have to start from scratch instead of the current residence"
16,What role do you think social equity and access to opportunity play in discussions about zoning and housing policy?,"Well, I do believe that the social, like the social aspect of this would definitely be how safe is it and if there's good hardworking people or there's bad people, I kind of think that all depends and then like the opportunity as well would just, you know, just be more job opportunities. But again, I kind of think the social part would just be if you have good, solid people or bad people in your neighborhood."
17,How confident are you that changes in Higher density housing lead to changes in Support for Upzoning? Does it have a positive effect (increasing it) or a negative effect (decreasing it)? How strong is this effect?,"I definitely think it will have a positive effect, just for the fact like I've stated before, you know, like there'd be more job opportunities, there'd be more stuff just running around your neighborhood like more stuff being built more trees being planted, and just a better community overall. So, like I kind of think that that would be a pretty strong effect."
18,"What might lead to increases or decreases in Support for Upzoning, and how significant are these effects? Please also indicate if these influences are positive (increasing) or negative (decreasing).","I think what would lead to increases in support would be the overall environment and the money that we bring into the community and to build an overall better community. But again, I kind of think the decreasing effect would definitely be if the people that are moving into the neighborhood are good people or bad people."
19,"Does Safety have a positive or negative effect on Support for Upzoning, and how significant is this effect? Does it have a positive effect (increasing it) or a negative effect (decreasing it)? How strong is this effect?","Again, it all depends, um, you know, I mean, just like I said before, it kind of depends on the people themselves. Like for example, if the people that are moving into your neighborhood are good, solid people that that have jobs and have a good life, then yes, it'd be a positive effect. But if the people that are moving into your neighborhood are quote unquote ghetto or like quote unquote, not good people, then it'd have a negative effect and, and the strength of that effect would matter on the people."
20,"Would small changes in Population density lead to noticeable changes in Support for Upzoning, or would it take larger shifts? Does it have a positive effect (increasing it) or a negative effect (decreasing it)? How strong is this effect?","Yes, I do believe small changes would lead to noticeable changes. For example, if that population is a good, hard-working population, then it could be good for your community, meaning more trees planted, more jobs to do, more cars on the road, more houses to be built. But then it also could lead to a negative effect, meaning the people could steal, the people could try to break into your cars and take all your belongings."
21,How confident are you that changes in People lead to changes in Support for Upzoning? Does it have a positive effect (increasing it) or a negative effect (decreasing it)? How strong is this effect?,"I'm pretty confident. I do think that people can lead to changes and support, and I do think it would have a positive effect. The strength of the effect would probably be pretty minimal, but it could also be pretty big if the people themselves are working pretty hard."
22,"Is the effect of Traffic Congestion on Support for Upzoning immediate, or does it take time to develop? Does it have a positive effect (increasing it) or a negative effect (decreasing it)? How strong is this effect?",It honestly all depends on the situation. I do believe that traffic congestion could be pretty viable. But then I also think it can take time to develop if people don't have jobs right away. But then I do think would be a negative effect just for the fact that like it'd be a lot more louder on the roads. And then I also believe that like it take you a pretty good amount of time to get to work at that point.
23,"Is the effect of Population Increase on Support for Upzoning immediate, or does it take time to develop? Does it have a positive effect (increasing it) or a negative effect (decreasing it)? How strong is this effect?","So for the population increase, I'd definitely say it'd be pretty immediate just for the fact that the people are present and they'd already be in their houses by then. Again, I personally think it'd be a positive effect because your community will definitely be bigger and stronger. There'd be more job opportunities and there'd be more stuff to do around your neighborhood environment. The strength of that effect would probably be pretty immediate."
24,How confident are you that changes in Housing spacing lead to changes in Support for Upzoning? Does it have a positive effect (increasing it) or a negative effect (decreasing it)? How strong is this effect?,so for so for the housing spacing I would think that it would lead to a positive effect just for the fact that you know like I kind of think like again like it make your community stronger and better and I think the strength of that effect would be pretty pretty good
25,"Is the effect of Carbon emissions on Support for Upzoning immediate, or does it take time to develop? Does it have a positive effect (increasing it) or a negative effect (decreasing it)? How strong is this effect?","So for the carbon emissions part, I do believe that would be pretty immediate just for the fact that the people are already present and then stuff like that. But I mean, I do think it'd have a pretty negative effect just for the fact that our world is kind of in a climate change crisis. So I do believe that the strength of that effect would be pretty high."
26,"Would small changes in Community growth lead to noticeable changes in Support for Upzoning, or would it take larger shifts? Does it have a positive effect (increasing it) or a negative effect (decreasing it)? How strong is this effect?","I do believe that small growth in community would lead to changes in support and I do believe it'd have a positive effect just for the fact like I've stated before, it'll lead to better jobs and a better community for you and your family. And I also believe it create more like I believe it create more of an environment for you and your family as well, the strength of that effect will be pretty high as well."
27,"Does Balancing interests between current and future residents have a positive or negative effect on Support for Upzoning, and how significant is this effect? Does it have a positive effect (increasing it) or a negative effect (decreasing it)? How strong is this effect?","I think that balancing interests would have a pretty positive impact for support of upzoning. I think the effect would be pretty significant, and it'd have a positive effect, that the strength would be pretty immediate, but again, I do believe that it'd be a pretty good positive balance for our future residents."
28,"Does Job opportunities have a positive or negative effect on Support for Upzoning, and how significant is this effect? Does it have a positive effect (increasing it) or a negative effect (decreasing it)? How strong is this effect?","I do think that job opportunities would have a positive impact just because your community would be more sought together and You'd have more money flowing into your neighborhood, which could lead to positive impacts to your environment And I think it'd be a positive impact and I think the strength that effect would be pretty large"
29,"Is the effect of Positive Effect on Support for Upzoning on Support for Upzoning immediate, or does it take time to develop? Does it have a positive effect (increasing it) or a negative effect (decreasing it)? How strong is this effect?","So, for the effect of upzoning, I do believe that it'd be a positive effect and it would take some time to develop, but I do think it'd be worth it just for the fact that your community will be more sought together, and I think the strength of that effect will be pretty large again."
30,"Does Community Improvement have a positive or negative effect on Support for Upzoning, and how significant is this effect? Does it have a positive effect (increasing it) or a negative effect (decreasing it)? How strong is this effect?",I think the community improvement would have a positive impact and the significant value of that impact would be pretty large. And I do believe that the strength that effect would be pretty large as well. Just for the fact that you'd have more housing and more job opportunities available.
31,"What factors do you think influence Upzoning policies, and how strong is their impact? Please also indicate if these influences are positive (increasing) or negative (decreasing).",I think the factors that influence the upzoning policies would be the amount of people that live there as well as your community. If it's like a great community or a bad community and the so for the influences I do believe that it could be positive or negative but overall I do think it'd be increasing and be a very good overall thing for your community.
