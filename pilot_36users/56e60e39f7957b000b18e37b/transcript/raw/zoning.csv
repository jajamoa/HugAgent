6,Excellent! We're now ready to begin the interview about urban zoning policies. Take your time with each response and provide as much detail as you'd like. Let's start with our first question.,let's start
7,To what extent do you support or oppose upzoning policies that allow for higher density housing in traditionally single-family neighborhoods? Please explain your reasoning.,"I am not a fan of these new upzoning policies because it is going to result in middle class and working class homes losing value, open the door to more crime, and these same types of buildings are not being built in rich areas so I see it as a form of class warfare."
8,"What do you think are the most significant impacts, positive or negative, of increasing housing density in residential neighborhoods?",I think the biggest impact will be the reduction in value of the surrounding single family homes. New upzoning should be limited to specific areas where they will not be disruptive to the local economy.
9,How do you think upzoning policies might affect housing affordability in urban areas?,I think the housing prices will go down because the value of the single homes will go down
10,What impact do you believe increased housing density might have on neighborhood character and quality of life?,The neighborhood's quality will significantly decrease because views will be blocked and too many people will be suddenly arriving in small areas that previously were not built to handle this number of residents.
11,How do you think upzoning might affect transportation systems and traffic congestion in cities?,They will almost certainly become worse as the population increases but the transportation infrastructure remains the same.
12,What role do you believe local government should play in regulating housing development and density?,Housing deployment and density should be regulated to the extent that neighborhoods are protected and these new buildings are limited to newly developed areas rather than being placed in existing neighborhoods.
13,How might environmental concerns factor into decisions about urban density and zoning?,Certainly higher population will bring higher pollution
14,"What economic effects, both positive and negative, might result from changing zoning laws to allow more multi-family housing?",I think it could allow for growth in the total number of people which could help some local businesses but it will also bring a series of problems that come with low income housing.
15,How do you think the interests of current residents versus future residents should be balanced when making zoning decisions?,I think the current residents should be given priority and allowed to vote on these zoning decisions.
16,What role do you think social equity and access to opportunity play in discussions about zoning and housing policy?,They should be considered but not the deciding factor.
17,"Is the effect of Middle class homes losing value on Support for Upzoning immediate, or does it take time to develop? Does it have a positive effect (increasing it) or a negative effect (decreasing it)? How strong is this effect?",This effect will likely happen almost immediately and will have a strongly negative effect.
18,What causes changes in Support for Upzoning? Are these influences strong or weak?,I think how people are affected is what determines the amount of support. The worse people are affected the stronger the resistance will be.
19,How would you describe the relationship between Reduction in value of single-family homes and Support for Upzoning? Is it a strong or weak connection? Does it have a positive effect (increasing it) or a negative effect (decreasing it)? How strong is this effect?,I think it is a negative effect when you are decreasing the value of the existing homes in the area and forcing it on people will only galvanize them against the idea.
20,"Would small changes in Decrease in home values lead to noticeable changes in Support for Upzoning, or would it take larger shifts? Does it have a positive effect (increasing it) or a negative effect (decreasing it)? How strong is this effect?",I think even small changes in home values will lead to strong resistance against upzoning because people are already living with razor thin margins.
21,How would you describe the relationship between Blocked views and Support for Upzoning? Is it a strong or weak connection? Does it have a positive effect (increasing it) or a negative effect (decreasing it)? How strong is this effect?,The more views are blocked the more people will dislike upzoning. It is a strong connection.
22,"Is the effect of Population increase on Support for Upzoning immediate, or does it take time to develop? Does it have a positive effect (increasing it) or a negative effect (decreasing it)? How strong is this effect?",The effect will be almost immediate in my opinion and it will have a strong negative effect as more people become affected.
23,"Is the effect of Limiting new buildings in existing neighborhoods on Support for Upzoning immediate, or does it take time to develop? Does it have a positive effect (increasing it) or a negative effect (decreasing it)? How strong is this effect?",The limiting of new buildings in existing neighborhoods would obviously not have a fast effect because nothing is changing but when things do change the effect will become stronger.
24,"Does Pollution have a positive or negative effect on Support for Upzoning, and how significant is this effect? Does it have a positive effect (increasing it) or a negative effect (decreasing it)? How strong is this effect?",Pollution will increase with the population so cramming more people into a small area will definitely strongly increase pollution and people know this.
25,"Does Impact on local businesses have a positive or negative effect on Support for Upzoning, and how significant is this effect? Does it have a positive effect (increasing it) or a negative effect (decreasing it)? How strong is this effect?",I think sudden increase in population will make it harder to get jobs as positions become filled and economic conditions will become more strongly effected the higher the population or upzoning becomes.
26,How confident are you that changes in Voting rights in zoning decisions lead to changes in Support for Upzoning? Does it have a positive effect (increasing it) or a negative effect (decreasing it)? How strong is this effect?,I don't think changes in voting rights will effect support for upzoning because most people will be voting against it happening where they live.
27,How would you describe the relationship between Zoning Policy and Support for Upzoning? Is it a strong or weak connection? Does it have a positive effect (increasing it) or a negative effect (decreasing it)? How strong is this effect?,Zoning policy and support for upzoning are probably inversely related and likely to have a strongly negative effect as the drawbacks become apparent to the voting population.
28,How confident are you that changes in Negative Effect lead to changes in Support for Upzoning? Does it have a positive effect (increasing it) or a negative effect (decreasing it)? How strong is this effect?,"Definitely a negative effect, if something brings negative consequences then people are going to not like it and support will be reduced as the negative effects become more apparent over time."
29,"Does People's perception of impact have a positive or negative effect on Support for Upzoning, and how significant is this effect? Does it have a positive effect (increasing it) or a negative effect (decreasing it)? How strong is this effect?",People's perception have an effect on their support just as much as the reality. If they perceive something to be a harm to their prosperity or their livelihood then it is just the same as whether it were a perception or the reality because what matters is how an individual perceives the reality.
30,How would you describe the relationship between Strength of resistance and Support for Upzoning? Is it a strong or weak connection? Does it have a positive effect (increasing it) or a negative effect (decreasing it)? How strong is this effect?,The strength of resistance will rise in equal amount to the support for upzoning depending on how people feel about it.
31,"What factors affect Upzoning policies, and which ones have the strongest influence? Please also indicate if these influences are positive (increasing) or negative (decreasing).","The way people's home prices are effected, whether crime goes up, whether local jobs become harder to get, all of these things are likely to have a negative effect on support for upzoning."
32,How would you describe the relationship between Resistance against upzoning and Support for Upzoning? Is it a strong or weak connection? Does it have a positive effect (increasing it) or a negative effect (decreasing it)? How strong is this effect?,"It is a strong connection in the sense that it is inverse, as resistance grows, support weakens and vice versa."
