Question Number,Question,Answer
1,To what extent do you support or oppose the widespread deployment of surveillance cameras in public spaces? Please explain your reasoning.,I support
2,"What do you think are the most significant impacts, positive or negative, of increasing surveillance camera coverage in urban areas?","Positive is that helps to pin point an incident or accident that might happen and help to clarify the circumstances! I also believe there would be less crime in my opinion because people are knowingly, knowing that they’re being watched which could cause them to act more appropriate."
3,How do you think surveillance technologies might affect public safety and crime rates?,"I think surveillance tech technologies would affect public safety and crime rates in a positive way! For example, it could affect crime rates because it could help investigators and police officers in their cases."
4,What impact do you believe increased surveillance might have on personal privacy and individual liberties?,it might feel intrusive which could change the sense of community and trust. I’m concerned that increased surveillance might feel intrusive and that there has to be a balance that does not come at the cost of our fundamental rights!
5,How do you think surveillance camera systems might affect community trust and police-community relations?,"I think it really depends on how they are implemented, managed, and over seen. Transparency, community involvement in decision making and clear guidelines for data use and access are crucial to maximizing any potential benefits while minimizing the risks to trust and cicvi liberties because without these safeguards the increased surveillance could easily lead to deterioration of police community relations and a decrease in trust ."
6,What role do you believe government should play in regulating surveillance technologies and data collection?,the government needs to create rules of the road for surveillance to protect people’s rights while still allowing for legitimate uses!
7,"Is the effect of Privacy concerns on Support for surveillance camera immediate, or does it take time to develop? Does it have a positive effect (increasing it) or a negative effect (decreasing it)? How strong is this effect?","if the cameras work well right away then people will support them, but if they don’t work well right away, people aren’t going to support them"
8,"Is the effect of Legitimate uses of surveillance on Support for surveillance camera immediate, or does it take time to develop? Does it have a positive effect (increasing it) or a negative effect (decreasing it)? How strong is this effect?","If we see the camera being used for good reasons, like catching the bad guys or criminals you could say, finding missing kids, then definitely yes that makes me feel better about them so more support. It feels like they’re helping so that’s a strong positive towards liking them. if they are being used for dumb stuff like giving out tickets for little things and watching everyone’s businesses would make me feel negative right away. that feeling would be pretty strong and make me not trust them. and I wanna see it just depends on what they are doing."
9,How might technological concerns about accuracy and reliability factor into decisions about surveillance systems?,"if cameras are dodgy and miss things a lot then that makes me not want to trust them. why all they’re having them if they’re not going to work right? That feeling would be pretty strong making me not want them around. If they are spot on. and get the job done and does the job correctly then I would definitely feel better about them. So what it comes down to is, how dependable and reliable are they? Is a quick thing that I worry about and it would have a pretty big say in weather I thought they were a good idea or not."
10,How confident are you that changes in Thorough testing lead to changes in Support for surveillance camera? Does it have a positive effect (increasing it) or a negative effect (decreasing it)? How strong is this effect?,I am extremely confident that if they are thoroughly testing the camera aand and using them properly makes a big difference in how I feel about them. If they say that they’ve really tested them and that they are working properly that makes me feel better about the whole entire thing. But if it sounds like they just slap them up without testing them first and checking that they work properly makes me feel nervous and less trusting.
11,"Would small changes in Independent evaluations lead to noticeable changes in Support for surveillance camera, or would it take larger shifts? Does it have a positive effect (increasing it) or a negative effect (decreasing it)? How strong is this effect?","yes, even small changea and what independent people say would lead to noticeable changes in my support being more supportive"
12,How confident are you that changes in Protection of people's rights lead to changes in Support for surveillance camera? Does it have a positive effect (increasing it) or a negative effect (decreasing it)? How strong is this effect?,"Putting in lots of cameras could create some jobs and maybe help with safety money-wise but it also costs a lot to start and keep going, and it could make people feel less private, which might hurt the local economy in other ways."
13,"Is the effect of Accuracy on Support for surveillance camera immediate, or does it take time to develop? Does it have a positive effect (increasing it) or a negative effect (decreasing it)? How strong is this effect?",The effect of accuracy on support for surveillance camera is immediate for me! if the cameras provide a high track record for accuracy This would lead to a positive effect. Increasing my support.
14,"What economic effects, both positive and negative, might result from investing in widespread surveillance infrastructure?",More cameras could mean more jobs and maybe save money on crime in the long run. But it cost a lot upfront and to keep it all running and it could make some people not want to spend as much time here which could hurt local businesses!
15,How do you think the interests of law enforcement versus privacy advocates should be balanced when making surveillance policy?,I think the key is finding the balance. The goal should be to build trust between law-enforcement and community and that requires respecting privacy and safety!
16,What role do you think social equity and potential bias play in discussions about surveillance technologies?,Ignoring social equity nd the potential for bias in these discussions would honestly be a big mistake. It could lead to a system that makes our town less trusting for neighbors.
17,"Is the effect of Public safety on Support for surveillance camera immediate, or does it take time to develop? Does it have a positive effect (increasing it) or a negative effect (decreasing it)? How strong is this effect?",Yes it’s immediate! The feeling of public safety has an immediate effect on my support! If it genuinely makes Lewistown feel safer then support goes up strongly! If it doesn’t change things at all or makes it feel worse in a different way then the support will either decrease or stay lower.
18,"What might lead to increases or decreases in Support for surveillance camera, and how significant are these effects? Please also indicate if these influences are positive (increasing) or negative (decreasing).","Public safety and privacy are concerns so changes related to these will likely have the most impact on support. Transparency, accuracy, accountability, and fairness are also important for building a maintaining trust in surveillance systems."
19,"Is the effect of Incident clarification on Support for surveillance camera immediate, or does it take time to develop? Does it have a positive effect (increasing it) or a negative effect (decreasing it)? How strong is this effect?","the effect of cameras, clarifying incidents can be immediate and is generally positive when it works well and brings clear and fair understanding. When it doesn’t clarify or is used inproper or  poorly the effect is less strong but can be neutral or slightly negative!"
20,How confident are you that changes in Personal Privacy lead to changes in Support for surveillance camera? Does it have a positive effect (increasing it) or a negative effect (decreasing it)? How strong is this effect?,The effect of personal privacy in support for surveillance cameras is strong and negative. If I feel like my privacy is being threatened or intruded my support will decrease a lot.
21,How confident are you that changes in Transparency lead to changes in Support for surveillance camera? Does it have a positive effect (increasing it) or a negative effect (decreasing it)? How strong is this effect?,Transparency has a very strong positive effect on my support. I feel like the more open the town is the more OK I will be with it. and the less transparent that they are is the less support they get from me.
22,How would you describe the relationship between Potential risks to civil liberties and Support for surveillance camera? Is it a strong or weak connection? Does it have a positive effect (increasing it) or a negative effect (decreasing it)? How strong is this effect?,It’s very strong and negative.
23,How confident are you that changes in Reliability lead to changes in Support for surveillance camera? Does it have a positive effect (increasing it) or a negative effect (decreasing it)? How strong is this effect?,Cameras that work well make me more supportive and cameras that don’t work well and always failing make me less supportive
24,How confident are you that changes in Informed decision making lead to changes in Support for surveillance camera? Does it have a positive effect (increasing it) or a negative effect (decreasing it)? How strong is this effect?,informed decision making has a very strong positive effect on my support. the more the town involves us and helps us understand the more likely i am to be supportive an the less they do then the more i’ll oppose that!
25,"Is the effect of Ongoing monitoring on Support for surveillance camera immediate, or does it take time to develop? Does it have a positive effect (increasing it) or a negative effect (decreasing it)? How strong is this effect?",The real impact of my support would develop over time based on how effective that monitoring actually carried out and what the outcomes are which can be either positive or negative with a moderate strength depending on the success or failure of the monitoring system efforts!
26,"Does Public disclosure have a positive or negative effect on Support for surveillance camera, and how significant is this effect? Does it have a positive effect (increasing it) or a negative effect (decreasing it)? How strong is this effect?",Public disclosure has a moderately strong positive effect on my support for surveillance cameras. Personally the more open the town is the more likely I am okay with them. A lack of disclosure leads to negativity less support!
27,"Is the effect of Community input on Support for surveillance camera immediate, or does it take time to develop? Does it have a positive effect (increasing it) or a negative effect (decreasing it)? How strong is this effect?",There is a big immediate positive reaction to the effort of getting community input! The real and stronger effect on my supper for surveillance cameras depends on weather the input is genuinely valued and acted on over time! of can be a huge positive if done well and a huge negative if done poorly!
28,"What factors do you think influence Increased surveillance effectiveness, and how strong is their impact? Please also indicate if these influences are positive (increasing) or negative (decreasing).","What it all comes down to is good technology, smart placement, and people paying attention to make cameras work better and function was a whole. Bad quality, missing spots and lagging or technical performance issues and no trust make them not work well at all!"
29,"What factors do you think influence Surveillance Technologies, and how strong is their impact? Please also indicate if these influences are positive (increasing) or negative (decreasing).",It feels like the push for more surveillance would come from a desire for safety and whatever new technology is available. But what could slow it down is us regular people worrying about our privacy and weather the town can afford it and be trusted with it!
30,"What might lead to increases or decreases in Increased Surveillance, and how significant are these effects? Please also indicate if these influences are positive (increasing) or negative (decreasing).",It feels like big safety concerns would be the main driver for more surveillance while still worrying about our privacy ns weather the cameras even work effectively would be the main reasons we’d want LESS. Money would also play a big role.
31,What causes changes in Implementation of surveillance systems? Are these influences strong or weak?,"Right now, with Millers getting robbed recently I would have to say there’s probably some leans towards more surveillance in town. But that could easily change if privacy concerns get louder or if the existing system doesn’t work or seem to be helping!!! Feeling less safety, if there’s been recent break-ins on our streets for example. I could definitely see a push for more cameras to make us feel secure again, significant increase is very likely. The robbery at a local store in town called Millers Grocery that happened last month really shakes some people up. if the current cameras didn’t help much then yes definitely be about getting better and more coverage with significant increase likely. I also recently saw something in my local paper about the state having funds for community tech. if the town applied and got the grant specifically for more cameras that would definitely lead to an increase."
