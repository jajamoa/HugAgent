Question Number,Question,Answer
1,To what extent do you support or oppose the widespread deployment of surveillance cameras in public spaces? Please explain your reasoning.,"I support the widespread deployment of surveillance cameras in public spaces. I think if people have something to hide, they should stay in their house."
2,"What do you think are the most significant impacts, positive or negative, of increasing surveillance camera coverage in urban areas?",I think the most significant impact is that people would feel like the government is spying on them. So that's a negative. I think the positive would be it would be great to feel safer in areas that might be less safe right now.
3,How do you think surveillance technologies might affect public safety and crime rates?,I think crime rates would probably decrease and public safety would increase.
4,What impact do you believe increased surveillance might have on personal privacy and individual liberties?,"The impact, I believe, with increased surveillance would not bother me with regard to my personal privacy. I look for personal privacy in my home, but I have no expectation of personal privacy in public."
5,How do you think surveillance camera systems might affect community trust and police-community relations?,I think as far as the community trust situation with police it's already pretty low and adding cameras I don't think it's going to affect that.
6,What role do you believe government should play in regulating surveillance technologies and data collection?,"I think that it should be twofold. The government should play a role in regulating this surveillance technology, but I also think there should be third parties who are monitoring the government data collection."
7,How might technological concerns about accuracy and reliability factor into decisions about surveillance systems?,With any technology there are concerns about accuracy and reliability but I think that's where the third-party company would come in to making sure that the surveillance systems are on track.
8,"What economic effects, both positive and negative, might result from investing in widespread surveillance infrastructure?",I think economic effects would be positive. I think stores that are routinely vandalized or people who have challenges with keeping their businesses safe at night would be positive.
9,How do you think the interests of law enforcement versus privacy advocates should be balanced when making surveillance policy?,"I think the interests of law enforcement are already pretty well established. I think the privacy advocates, if they have an issue, should stay home."
10,What role do you think social equity and potential bias play in discussions about surveillance technologies?,I think social equity and bias play a big part in the discussion about surveillance technologies. I would hope that whoever is training the AI that is surveilling the surveillance technologies is well trained to have no bias.
11,"Does Privacy concerns have a positive or negative effect on Support for surveillance camera, and how significant is this effect? Does it have a positive effect (increasing it) or a negative effect (decreasing it)? How strong is this effect?","I think it's probably split half and half. A lot of people have a positive effect on the support for surveillance and there are people with a negative. I think that if someone has something to hide, they're going to see it as a negative effect and want to decrease it. And people who are looking for more safety and more accountability are going to have a positive effect."
12,"What factors do you think influence Support for surveillance camera, and how strong is their impact? Please also indicate if these influences are positive (increasing) or negative (decreasing).","Factors that influence support for surveillance cameras would be safety, being able to be out at night, businesses staying open and not having as much concern for criminal activities. I think the impact for that would be very strong and a very positive impact."
13,How would you describe the relationship between Negative perception of surveillance and Support for surveillance camera? Is it a strong or weak connection? Does it have a positive effect (increasing it) or a negative effect (decreasing it)? How strong is this effect?,"I think there is a relationship between negative perception of surveillance and support for surveillance. I think that it is a weak connection. I think everyone wants to feel safe, but people recognize that there are bias and discriminatory practices in law enforcement. So if you give surveillance cameras to law enforcement, the fear is that it will be a negative effect."
14,"Would small changes in Increase in public safety lead to noticeable changes in Support for surveillance camera, or would it take larger shifts? Does it have a positive effect (increasing it) or a negative effect (decreasing it)? How strong is this effect?","Yes, I do think that small changes in public safety over time would lead to more support for the surveillance camera initiatives. I think the larger shift would happen over a longer amount of time."
15,"Does Personal Privacy have a positive or negative effect on Support for surveillance camera, and how significant is this effect? Does it have a positive effect (increasing it) or a negative effect (decreasing it)? How strong is this effect?","The idea that people think they can have personal privacy when they're in public is a significant lack of understanding. There is no expectation of privacy once you leave your home. So I do think the effect would be a positive thing if people could see it for what it is. Surveillance cameras, looking for people doing something wrong, not trying to invade your privacy."
16,"Would small changes in Community trust in police lead to noticeable changes in Support for surveillance camera, or would it take larger shifts? Does it have a positive effect (increasing it) or a negative effect (decreasing it)? How strong is this effect?","I think small changes in community trust in police could lead to noticeable changes in support for surveillance cameras, but one needs to happen long before the other. The community doesn't trust police because police are humans and humans have bias and stereotype and prejudice. So I think that's where the surveillance cameras come in. Not only are they looking at civilians, but they're also watching law enforcement."
17,How would you describe the relationship between Surveillance technologies and Support for surveillance camera? Is it a strong or weak connection? Does it have a positive effect (increasing it) or a negative effect (decreasing it)? How strong is this effect?,I think it's a strong connection between surveillance technologies and support for surveillance cameras. I think that it would be a positive effect and it's a very strong effect.
18,"Would small changes in Third-party oversight lead to noticeable changes in Support for surveillance camera, or would it take larger shifts? Does it have a positive effect (increasing it) or a negative effect (decreasing it)? How strong is this effect?","I believe small changes in third-party oversight could lead to noticeable changes in support, but in order for that to happen, the third party needs to get the community's trust first."
19,How would you describe the relationship between Positive economic effects and Support for surveillance camera? Is it a strong or weak connection? Does it have a positive effect (increasing it) or a negative effect (decreasing it)? How strong is this effect?,I think it's a weak connection between positive economic effects and support for surveillance camera. You could be in a poor area that has a weak economic versus in a rich area that has strong economic and one or both could support surveillance cameras. I don't see a connection between those two.
20,"Would small changes in social equity lead to noticeable changes in Support for surveillance camera, or would it take larger shifts? Does it have a positive effect (increasing it) or a negative effect (decreasing it)? How strong is this effect?",I think it would require larger shifts in social equity to lead to noticeable changes in support for surveillance cameras. The minority groups that are typically targeted by law enforcement are not going to take kindly to surveillance cameras because of how law enforcement has been treating them. I do think the effect would be a negative effect unless the changes in social equity were large changes because then that could lead to more support for surveillance.
21,How would you describe the relationship between People with positive views on surveillance and Support for surveillance camera? Is it a strong or weak connection? Does it have a positive effect (increasing it) or a negative effect (decreasing it)? How strong is this effect?,"The relationship between people with positive views on surveillance and support for surveillance camera is a strong connection. I personally am a person with a positive view on surveillance, so I fully support surveillance cameras and I think it's a strong connection and that the effect would be positive and that effect would be strong."
22,How confident are you that changes in Being able to be out at night lead to changes in Support for surveillance camera? Does it have a positive effect (increasing it) or a negative effect (decreasing it)? How strong is this effect?,I personally would really think that the change in support for surveillance cameras would be for people who want to be out at night and feel safer. And I think that there would be a positive effect and it would be a strong effect.
23,"What factors do you think influence Support for surveillance cameras, and how strong is their impact? Please also indicate if these influences are positive (increasing) or negative (decreasing).",I think it would need to be very strategic to get people to be supportive of the surveillance cameras. The impact would need to start in neighborhoods where they wouldn't get as much pushback. You can't start surveillance cameras in poor neighborhoods with high crime. You need to start in neighborhoods where you won't get as much pushback. That way the influences would be positive and people would watch it in real time and want that same positive influence.
24,How confident are you that changes in Public Expectation of Privacy lead to changes in Support for surveillance camera? Does it have a positive effect (increasing it) or a negative effect (decreasing it)? How strong is this effect?,"I'm not confident that changes in public expectation of privacy would lead to changes in support of the surveillance cameras. I personally have no expectation of privacy when I'm in public, but I think other people do. And I think that the effect, whether that be positive or negative, is dependent on where those cameras are placed."
25,What causes changes in Government surveillance? Are these influences strong or weak?,"I think when you think of changes in government surveillance, you envision the influence being weak because the thought of government surveilling you sounds negative. The thought of a support for surveillance camera sounds like it's for the public. But when you word it with government surveillance, that influence feels weak."
26,"Does Positive effect have a positive or negative effect on Support for surveillance camera, and how significant is this effect? Does it have a positive effect (increasing it) or a negative effect (decreasing it)? How strong is this effect?","Positive effect has a positive effect on support or surveillance camera. And I think the significance is that if there is a positive effect, it is going to be strong."
