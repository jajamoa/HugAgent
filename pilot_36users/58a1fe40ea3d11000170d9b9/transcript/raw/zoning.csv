5,"As the interview progresses, you'll notice the progress bar at the top of the screen showing your current position. Based on your responses, the system may generate follow-up questions to dive deeper into specific topics. These new questions will be added to your interview flow automatically. This helps us capture your thinking process more thoroughly.",ok
6,Excellent! We're now ready to begin the interview about urban zoning policies. Take your time with each response and provide as much detail as you'd like. Let's start with our first question.,"Okay, I'm ready."
7,To what extent do you support or oppose upzoning policies that allow for higher density housing in traditionally single-family neighborhoods? Please explain your reasoning.,I generally oppose this because where I live right now there is already an issue with higher density housing. There are too many people and it is way too crowded and traffic is a mess.
8,"What do you think are the most significant impacts, positive or negative, of increasing housing density in residential neighborhoods?","So, the more positive impact is more business for local businesses, more growth that will lead to sidewalks, parks, and things of that nature. Negative impacts are going to be mostly traffic and overcrowding."
9,How do you think upzoning policies might affect housing affordability in urban areas?,I think in urban areas it would decrease the cost of housing.
10,What impact do you believe increased housing density might have on neighborhood character and quality of life?,"Character and quality of life, it really depends. Like I said earlier, there could be more parks, more walkable areas, more businesses that are built. However, it could also lead to more congestion, which is negative."
11,How do you think upzoning might affect transportation systems and traffic congestion in cities?,I think it would negatively affect transportation systems and traffic congestion in cities would be even worse.
12,What role do you believe local government should play in regulating housing development and density?,I think the local government should have some restrictions in place for not allowing too many upscaling just because traffic can become unmovable.
13,How might environmental concerns factor into decisions about urban density and zoning?,"Environmental concerns are another thing, because more density means more environmental pollution."
14,"What economic effects, both positive and negative, might result from changing zoning laws to allow more multi-family housing?","The positive effects would be more people, more money, more thriving businesses. The negative effects would be... Well, I can't think of any negative economic effects necessarily."
15,How do you think the interests of current residents versus future residents should be balanced when making zoning decisions?,Future residents want more housing but current residents necessarily don't because of traffic congestion concerns so I think this is when local governments come into play to figure out if it's feasible to make these zoning decisions or if it will add too much traffic congestion.
16,What role do you think social equity and access to opportunity play in discussions about zoning and housing policy?,"Social equity and access to opportunity definitely play a big role. This is when larger apartment buildings are going to be built and it's going to change the landscape of places that don't already have these apartments and apartments definitely add more people, more so than just a couple of houses."
17,"Does Higher density housing have a positive or negative effect on Support for Upzoning, and how significant is this effect? Does it have a positive effect (increasing it) or a negative effect (decreasing it)? How strong is this effect?",Higher density housing I think does have a positive effect on upzoning because you've got more people and it just is a direct effect and it's going to be a strong effect.
18,"What might lead to increases or decreases in Support for Upzoning, and how significant are these effects? Please also indicate if these influences are positive (increasing) or negative (decreasing).","So people would support this if they want to develop the community and grow businesses, but people are going to decrease support for it if it's going to add traffic congestion and minimize the way the landscape looks."
19,"Does Positive Impact: Infrastructure Development have a positive or negative effect on Support for Upzoning, and how significant is this effect? Does it have a positive effect (increasing it) or a negative effect (decreasing it)? How strong is this effect?","So, I guess positive impact infrastructure development would have a positive effect on support for upzoning because infrastructure is extremely important and it needs to be settled before upzoning talks even begin. And it would make people more likely to support it."
20,"Does Housing affordability have a positive or negative effect on Support for Upzoning, and how significant is this effect? Does it have a positive effect (increasing it) or a negative effect (decreasing it)? How strong is this effect?","Housing affordability has a direct effect on support for upzoning. If upzoning is going to increase the cost of people's houses that they own, then those people will be more willing to support it. But if upzoning is going to decrease the cost of houses that people own, they're going to be less likely to support it. And now if people rent, and it's going to lower the price of rent, people are going to support it."
21,"Would small changes in Neighborhood character lead to noticeable changes in Support for Upzoning, or would it take larger shifts? Does it have a positive effect (increasing it) or a negative effect (decreasing it)? How strong is this effect?",Small changes in neighborhood character probably would lead to some changes in support for upzoning because if the neighborhood character becomes negative people might want to move and then they would not want to support projects like this in the future.
22,"Does More parks have a positive or negative effect on Support for Upzoning, and how significant is this effect? Does it have a positive effect (increasing it) or a negative effect (decreasing it)? How strong is this effect?","More perks would definitely have a positive effect on support for upzoning, but it depends exactly on what the perks are. If people are getting something out of it, then they'll support it."
23,"Does Negative impact on transportation systems have a positive or negative effect on Support for Upzoning, and how significant is this effect? Does it have a positive effect (increasing it) or a negative effect (decreasing it)? How strong is this effect?",Negative impact on transportation system has a very strong direct negative effect on support for upzoning because if transportation is going to be throttled no one's going to want to support it.
24,How would you describe the relationship between Housing development and Support for Upzoning? Is it a strong or weak connection? Does it have a positive effect (increasing it) or a negative effect (decreasing it)? How strong is this effect?,I think this is an interesting connection. It depends on where people are in life and what their housing needs are. So housing development and support for upzoning are a bit conflicting in my opinion. I think if people want to support housing they're not going to want to support upzoning.
25,"Is the effect of Environmental pollution on Support for Upzoning immediate, or does it take time to develop? Does it have a positive effect (increasing it) or a negative effect (decreasing it)? How strong is this effect?",I think the effect of environmental pollution is probably an immediate effect on people's support for upzoning. I think this because people will immediately consider environmental pollution as it becomes more real to them and after upzoning has happened people are going to see more of an effect but in the beginning they're going to consider it.
26,How confident are you that changes in Increased revenue lead to changes in Support for Upzoning? Does it have a positive effect (increasing it) or a negative effect (decreasing it)? How strong is this effect?,"I think increased revenue, when people are earning more individually, they're going to decrease their support for upzoning because they're going to want to focus more on their home, which is going to most likely be a house they own in their neighborhood. They're not going to want their neighborhood cluttered with apartments."
27,How would you describe the relationship between Current residents' interests and Support for Upzoning? Is it a strong or weak connection? Does it have a positive effect (increasing it) or a negative effect (decreasing it)? How strong is this effect?,I think current residents probably don't have a strong support for upzoning because they're used to things the way they are. That's a very strong connection. They're going to not support this because they're not going to want their city or their town to be overcrowded with traffic.
28,How would you describe the relationship between Zoning and Housing Policy and Support for Upzoning? Is it a strong or weak connection? Does it have a positive effect (increasing it) or a negative effect (decreasing it)? How strong is this effect?,"So, I would consider zoning to be changing areas around in order to create a housing policy for a particular zone, and I think zoning probably supports a housing policy in order to allow for more homes to be built in a particular area."
29,"What might lead to increases or decreases in Upzoning policies, and how significant are these effects? Please also indicate if these influences are positive (increasing) or negative (decreasing).","I think if an area has been rezoned and is considered rural now, then the upzoning policies are likely to increase. I think that's a strong direct impact."
30,How would you describe the relationship between Traffic congestion and Support for Upzoning? Is it a strong or weak connection? Does it have a positive effect (increasing it) or a negative effect (decreasing it)? How strong is this effect?,"That is an immediate strong impact. If traffic congestion is already bad, nobody is going to support upzoning. If it's a concern or a potential concern, that's also going to decrease support for upzoning."
31,How would you describe the relationship between Neighborhood character becoming negative and Support for Upzoning? Is it a strong or weak connection? Does it have a positive effect (increasing it) or a negative effect (decreasing it)? How strong is this effect?,"Of course, if people think that their neighborhood character is going to become negative, they're not going to support upzoning. It would be a fairly strong connection, but probably not at the top of the list. I think people want their neighborhood character to remain the same as it was when they moved in."
32,What causes changes in Positive Impact: Business Growth? Are these influences strong or weak?,I think business growth is going to be a strong positive impact. More businesses means more money in the community and that means more direct reflections that can be seen in the community like parks and artwork.
