Question Number,Question,Answer
1,To what extent do you support or oppose the widespread deployment of surveillance cameras in public spaces? Please explain your reasoning.,I definitely support widespread deployment of surveillance cameras in public spaces because they help keep public spaces safe.
2,"What do you think are the most significant impacts, positive or negative, of increasing surveillance camera coverage in urban areas?",I think the most significant impacts of increasing surveillance is people will be less likely to commit crimes. That's positive. I can't think of anything negative. 
3,How do you think surveillance technologies might affect public safety and crime rates?,And I think surveillance technologies would affect public safety and crime rates by lowering them.
4,What impact do you believe increased surveillance might have on personal privacy and individual liberties?,"I don't really care about personal privacy and personal liberties. People don't care that much. As long as their surveillance cameras are not able to view my credit card details, then it doesn't matter."
5,How do you think surveillance camera systems might affect community trust and police-community relations?,I think community trust might increase because they would feel safer.
6,What role do you believe government should play in regulating surveillance technologies and data collection?,The government needs to make sure that surveillance technologies and data collection are not getting personal information like credit cards.
7,How might technological concerns about accuracy and reliability factor into decisions about surveillance systems?,I guess people could be concerned that maybe face recognition is too good and can tell exactly who someone is and some people might be uncomfortable with that.
8,"What economic effects, both positive and negative, might result from investing in widespread surveillance infrastructure?",The only negative economic effect I can see is that it would be very expensive to implement.
9,How do you think the interests of law enforcement versus privacy advocates should be balanced when making surveillance policy?,"The interest of law enforcement versus privacy advocates, well I think we need to know what law enforcement is doing and I think that should be upfront told to police officers and people could also be made aware that they will be on camera when they're gonna be on camera and that makes privacy fair because people have been warned."
10,What role do you think social equity and potential bias play in discussions about surveillance technologies?,I guess people could misuse cameras to target minorities. That could be the potential bias that could come into effect.
11,How confident are you that changes in Public safety lead to changes in Support for surveillance camera? Does it have a positive effect (increasing it) or a negative effect (decreasing it)? How strong is this effect?,"I definitely think that changes in public safety lead to changes in support for surveillance. If there's no public safety, people are going to want surveillance more."
12,"What factors affect Support for surveillance camera, and which ones have the strongest influence? Please also indicate if these influences are positive (increasing) or negative (decreasing).","I think something that affects support for surveillance camera is, like we just said, public safety in the area. That's going to be number one. If an area isn't safe, people are going to want surveillance cameras. That's going to be very strong influence. Another thing might be high crime rates in an area. That would also be a strong influence."
13,"Does Deterrence effect on crime have a positive or negative effect on Support for surveillance camera, and how significant is this effect? Does it have a positive effect (increasing it) or a negative effect (decreasing it)? How strong is this effect?",Deterrent's effect on crime definitely has a positive effect on support for surveillance camera because nobody wants to be a victim of crime so they'll support.
14,How confident are you that changes in Feeling safer lead to changes in Support for surveillance camera? Does it have a positive effect (increasing it) or a negative effect (decreasing it)? How strong is this effect?,"Definitely. Changes in feeling safer lead to changes in support for surveillance. I think people who don't have it are going to, or don't have safety I mean, are going to support surveillance cameras more than people who are maybe used to it and feel safe. People who already feel safe aren't going to work for surveillance cameras."
15,How confident are you that changes in Personal information protection lead to changes in Support for surveillance camera? Does it have a positive effect (increasing it) or a negative effect (decreasing it)? How strong is this effect?,Personal information protection is something that's important because people want their personal information to be protected and if they feel like it is then they might support surveillance cameras but if they feel like it's a threat then they will not support surveillance cameras because their personal information protection is top priority to them.
16,"Does Privacy concerns have a positive or negative effect on Support for surveillance camera, and how significant is this effect? Does it have a positive effect (increasing it) or a negative effect (decreasing it)? How strong is this effect?","Privacy concerns is going to have a negative effect on support for surveillance. It's going to be a strong effect because if people have privacy concerns about surveillance cameras, they're definitely not going to want to support them."
17,"Does Law Enforcement Accountability have a positive or negative effect on Support for surveillance camera, and how significant is this effect? Does it have a positive effect (increasing it) or a negative effect (decreasing it)? How strong is this effect?",Law enforcement accountability also is something extremely important for surveillance cameras. If people feel that law enforcement is going to be held accountable then they will trust law enforcement and they will trust the surveillance cameras. If law enforcement is not held accountable people aren't going to trust them so they won't trust surveillance cameras.
18,"Does Potential Bias have a positive or negative effect on Support for surveillance camera, and how significant is this effect? Does it have a positive effect (increasing it) or a negative effect (decreasing it)? How strong is this effect?",Potential bias has a negative effect on support for surveillance cameras because no one wants to be discriminated against and if adding a camera is going to cause that then nobody's going to want to support it.
19,"What might lead to increases or decreases in Surveillance cameras, and how significant are these effects? Please also indicate if these influences are positive (increasing) or negative (decreasing).","I think increases in surveillance cameras would come at the cost of increase in crime in a particular area or increase in a wealthy neighborhood. The more wealthy people there are, the more they're going to want to have these security cameras to feel safe."
20,"Is the effect of Support for surveillance cameras on Support for surveillance camera immediate, or does it take time to develop? Does it have a positive effect (increasing it) or a negative effect (decreasing it)? How strong is this effect?",I think the support for surveillance cameras probably takes time to develop. People might be against it to begin with but then see the benefits of it later down the road.
21,How would you describe the relationship between Negative effect and Support for surveillance camera? Is it a strong or weak connection? Does it have a positive effect (increasing it) or a negative effect (decreasing it)? How strong is this effect?,"There's a strong relationship between negative effect and support for surveillance camera. If there's a negative effect in the area, like common crimes or robberies, then people are very strongly going to support surveillance cameras."
22,"Would small changes in Trust in Law Enforcement lead to noticeable changes in Support for surveillance camera, or would it take larger shifts? Does it have a positive effect (increasing it) or a negative effect (decreasing it)? How strong is this effect?",I'm not sure if small changes in trust in law enforcement would lead to any noticeable changes in support for surveillance cameras. It would probably take longer to change and as support increases for law enforcement I think support for surveillance cameras would also increase.
23,"What factors affect Surveillance technologies, and which ones have the strongest influence? Please also indicate if these influences are positive (increasing) or negative (decreasing).",I'm not sure what you mean by what factors affect surveillance technologies. I guess outdoor ruggedness? If surveillance cameras are placed outdoors that would affect them strongly.
24,"Would small changes in Effect development over time lead to noticeable changes in Support for surveillance camera, or would it take larger shifts? Does it have a positive effect (increasing it) or a negative effect (decreasing it)? How strong is this effect?",Definitely small changes in effect development over time would lead to some noticeable changes in support for surveillance cameras because of course it would take time but this would be because if people don't see that it's beneficial they're not going to support surveillance cameras.
25,How would you describe the relationship between Strong relationship and Support for surveillance camera? Is it a strong or weak connection? Does it have a positive effect (increasing it) or a negative effect (decreasing it)? How strong is this effect?,"I think if people already have a strong relationship with surveillance cameras, they're going to support them. That's a strong connection and it's a direct positive impact."
26,How confident are you that changes in Positive effect on support lead to changes in Support for surveillance camera? Does it have a positive effect (increasing it) or a negative effect (decreasing it)? How strong is this effect?,"Positive effect on support will definitely lead to support for surveillance cameras because if people see a positive effect, they're very strongly going to want to support surveillance cameras."
