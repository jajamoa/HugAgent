This helps us capture your thinking process more thoroughly.",Alright let's talk!
6,Excellent! We're now ready to begin the interview about urban zoning policies. Take your time with each response and provide as much detail as you'd like. Let's start with our first question.,Ok.
7,To what extent do you support or oppose upzoning policies that allow for higher density housing in traditionally single-family neighborhoods? Please explain your reasoning.,"I don't support it at all. I'm worried that it'll cause overcrowding if cheaper apartments or housing were made. Aside from that, we know that statistically, lower income people tend to have more of the criminal population in them, isn't that right? So this might cause the crime rates to go up!"
8,"What do you think are the most significant impacts, positive or negative, of increasing housing density in residential neighborhoods?","I've mentioned the potential for crime rates to go up, that's the real worry here. Lots of new lower income people, lots of potential criminals."
9,How do you think upzoning policies might affect housing affordability in urban areas?,"They'd most likely lower the price of rent because of ""competition"". But at what cost? The safety of the people!"
10,What impact do you believe increased housing density might have on neighborhood character and quality of life?,Safety for sure. Low income places simply have more potential for crimes due to people being tempted to commit criminal acts for survival.
11,How do you think upzoning might affect transportation systems and traffic congestion in cities?,"It's going to worsen! Look, there was a time when I used to take the bus to get to work every day when I still didn't have a car. I live in a big city and sometimes, the bus couldn't take all of us! That caused me to get late a couple of times since there wasn't even any standing room. So imagine, a rush of new low income people to this area, probably they don't have cars so they'll rely on buses, it'll just be extra strain on the buses and not everyone would be able to get on the bus at all."
12,What role do you believe local government should play in regulating housing development and density?,"The government really shouldn't be too involved with many things. Just minimally involved. Less government involvement, the better."
13,How might environmental concerns factor into decisions about urban density and zoning?,"I don't personally care about these so-called ""environmental concerns"". I'm not some kind of environmental activist or terrified climate change believer. As long as something doesn't dump toxic waste or all sorts of hazardous material in my area, then it's good."
14,"What economic effects, both positive and negative, might result from changing zoning laws to allow more multi-family housing?","More new people, more potential customers for businesses in the area obviously. BUT we also have to think that these are low income people if we're talking about low income housing. So businesses targeting low income people would most likely benefit, but the more upscale ones wouldn't."
15,How do you think the interests of current residents versus future residents should be balanced when making zoning decisions?,"The current residents should ALWAYS be prioritized, they were there first. New people should always be considerate of the people living wherever they're planning to move to. It's just basic human decency."
16,What role do you think social equity and access to opportunity play in discussions about zoning and housing policy?,I am totally against EQUITY. Equity means taking opportunities away from someone in order to give it to somebody else who probably didn't earn it. I don't like the idea of redistributing what a successful person has.
17,How confident are you that changes in Higher density housing lead to changes in Support for Upzoning? Does it have a positive effect (increasing it) or a negative effect (decreasing it)? How strong is this effect?,"It's going to be NEGATIVE. If we're talking about people, it's not just quantity that we're supposed to worry about, but also the quality. So we can say ""Don't judge a book by their cover"", but we also must think that people are in the situation they are for a reason. So if we're going to get flooded by low income people, we have to ask, ""Why are they low income?"" Of course not all low income people are bad, but majority of criminals are low income people."
18,"What factors do you think influence Support for Upzoning, and how strong is their impact? Please also indicate if these influences are positive (increasing) or negative (decreasing).","Definitely the idea of SAFETY is a huge factor. Just imagine you live in a peaceful neighborhood where crime isn't really a problem, then suddenly a huge number of new low income people flood in to your community and suddenly kids start getting bullied at the playground, people start getting mugged left and right. Safety is really a big concern!"
19,"Does Crime rates have a positive or negative effect on Support for Upzoning, and how significant is this effect? Does it have a positive effect (increasing it) or a negative effect (decreasing it)? How strong is this effect?","That's what I've been talking about this entire conversation, the potential for CRIME! As I've already stated numerous times, it's a MAJOR concern and an influx of low income people would definitely affect the crime rate!"
20,"Would small changes in Housing affordability lead to noticeable changes in Support for Upzoning, or would it take larger shifts? Does it have a positive effect (increasing it) or a negative effect (decreasing it)? How strong is this effect?","At first people would probably think things will be better because rent might go down a bit, BUT that's not guaranteed. Second, SAFETY is really something that people are probably not willing to compromise."
21,"Would small changes in Safety lead to noticeable changes in Support for Upzoning, or would it take larger shifts? Does it have a positive effect (increasing it) or a negative effect (decreasing it)? How strong is this effect?","If there's really no way about avoiding the creation of some kind of tall low income apartment building for the sake of ""equity"", then the next best thing would be to thoroughly do background checks on all the renters. For example, there should be strictly nobody in there with a criminal record."
22,How would you describe the relationship between Low Income People and Support for Upzoning? Is it a strong or weak connection? Does it have a positive effect (increasing it) or a negative effect (decreasing it)? How strong is this effect?,"Well of course low income people would support the creation of low income rental building. But the problem is that people already living in the community, like me, wouldn't support it at all for fears of safety worsening."
23,"Is the effect of Minimal Regulation on Support for Upzoning immediate, or does it take time to develop? Does it have a positive effect (increasing it) or a negative effect (decreasing it)? How strong is this effect?",Any policy takes TIME to develop. Rushed policies just end up in disaster because it won't be well thought out.
24,"Would small changes in Impact on businesses lead to noticeable changes in Support for Upzoning, or would it take larger shifts? Does it have a positive effect (increasing it) or a negative effect (decreasing it)? How strong is this effect?","No. As I've said, low income people will only provide benefit to businesses targeting low income customers. Mid to upscale businesses wouldn't benefit from them because they won't be able to afford their products and services. In short, not all businesses would be in support of having some kind of low income housing in the area if all they're going to be able to afford are low income stuff."
25,How would you describe the relationship between Basic human decency and Support for Upzoning? Is it a strong or weak connection? Does it have a positive effect (increasing it) or a negative effect (decreasing it)? How strong is this effect?,"There are people who make decisions based on feelings alone. Yes, they'll think it's ""decent"" to allow low income people to have low income housing in their community, BUT often, these people don't think about the consequences that would affect the people already living in the community. They are too focused on helping others that they don't realize they are causing harm to themselves."
26,"Is the effect of Redistribution on Support for Upzoning immediate, or does it take time to develop? Does it have a positive effect (increasing it) or a negative effect (decreasing it)? How strong is this effect?","That's definitely going to be a huge NEGATIVE right away. Nobody in their right mind would want themselves to be compromised for others. So let's think about what happens if in a moderately wealthy area, they allowed low income housing in the name of ""equity"". For actual home owners (not renters), the value of their properties would go down. These are properties that they've worked for years to maintain, and suddenly, in the name of ""equity"", is it alright to allow the values to go down? No of course not! So we have to always think about how low income housing would affect the people already living in the community."
27,"Would small changes in Negative Effect lead to noticeable changes in Support for Upzoning, or would it take larger shifts? Does it have a positive effect (increasing it) or a negative effect (decreasing it)? How strong is this effect?","No, it's called ""Negative Effect"" because it affects people in a bad way. Nobody would support anything like that knowingly."
28,"What factors affect Upzoning policies, and which ones have the strongest influence? Please also indicate if these influences are positive (increasing) or negative (decreasing).","As I've been saying this entire conversation, the major facor that affects people's support for low income housing is the SAFETY, the potential for crime rates to go up, and these things will definitely always affect support for low income housing negatively."
29,"Does Community Resistance to Upzoning have a positive or negative effect on Support for Upzoning, and how significant is this effect? Does it have a positive effect (increasing it) or a negative effect (decreasing it)? How strong is this effect?","Of course community resistance won't support low income housing, that's the point. People would resist these places from being built in order to protect the community from potential safety concerns."
30,How would you describe the relationship between Time for policy development and Support for Upzoning? Is it a strong or weak connection? Does it have a positive effect (increasing it) or a negative effect (decreasing it)? How strong is this effect?,"Of course ""Time"" will always have something to do with whether low income housing would be allowed or not. For example, maybe a politician would take his time forming some kind of bill concerning low income housing and he'll wait for enough public support before officially launching it in order to increase its chances of succeeding."
31,"Would small changes in Low Income Housing lead to noticeable changes in Support for Upzoning, or would it take larger shifts? Does it have a positive effect (increasing it) or a negative effect (decreasing it)? How strong is this effect?","No, even small changes in low income housing won't change people's support for it because it will negatively affect the community. People already know it's most likely going to be the cause of many safety concerns aside from property devaluation."
32,"Does Equity have a positive or negative effect on Support for Upzoning, and how significant is this effect? Does it have a positive effect (increasing it) or a negative effect (decreasing it)? How strong is this effect?","Equity has NEGATIVE effects on people already living in the community, because the point of equity is to take from those people (land space) and to redistribute it to other people (the low income people). People might try to frame it as ""helping the poor"", but you can help poor people in other ways without harming the community."
33,How would you describe the relationship between Support for low income housing and Support for Upzoning? Is it a strong or weak connection? Does it have a positive effect (increasing it) or a negative effect (decreasing it)? How strong is this effect?,People are directly against low income housing because it's more likely to bring bad stuff with it that good ones. The consequences outweigh the positives.
