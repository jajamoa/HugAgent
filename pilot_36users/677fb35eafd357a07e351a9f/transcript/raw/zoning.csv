6,Excellent! We're now ready to begin the interview about urban zoning policies. Take your time with each response and provide as much detail as you'd like. Let's start with our first question.,would tall buildings bring tenants who are more prone towards criminal behavior?
7,To what extent do you support or oppose upzoning policies that allow for higher density housing in traditionally single-family neighborhoods? Please explain your reasoning.,"to be honest, my main concern is crime.  my family already lives in an area with a higher than average crime rate, and we really do not desire more criminal behavior being brought into the area"
8,"What do you think are the most significant impacts, positive or negative, of increasing housing density in residential neighborhoods?","on one hand, it helps provide affordable shelter for low income families, but also, it brings criminal behavior into the neighborhood"
9,How do you think upzoning policies might affect housing affordability in urban areas?,I believe that upzoning policies may lower housing costs in urban areas and provide more shelter opportunity for those in need
10,What impact do you believe increased housing density might have on neighborhood character and quality of life?,I believe that criminal culture will become pervasive in neighborhoods where increased housing density is allowed
11,How do you think upzoning might affect transportation systems and traffic congestion in cities?,I think that upzoning will increase traffic congestion
12,What role do you believe local government should play in regulating housing development and density?,I believe that local government should weigh the positive and negative consequences for all those individuals involved and should make a decision based upon the greater good
13,How might environmental concerns factor into decisions about urban density and zoning?,"increased urban density is likely to increase carbon output through transportation needs, and should be taken into consideration when deciding to approve"
14,"What economic effects, both positive and negative, might result from changing zoning laws to allow more multi-family housing?","retailers will have more customers, employers may find more workers, which means more tax dollars.  However, wealthier individuals may desire to move out of the neighborhood, leaving their expensive property  and high property tax dollars behind."
15,How do you think the interests of current residents versus future residents should be balanced when making zoning decisions?,"the needs of both may contradict each other.  current residents likely may not desire introduction of high density housing for fear of lowering property value, loss of quality of life.  however, future residents may desire affordable housing.  the interests of both parties are valid.  perhaps there is a balance that can be found where both parties can find some room to give a little for the betterment of all."
16,What role do you think social equity and access to opportunity play in discussions about zoning and housing policy?,"I do not believe that social equity will be acquired in this life.  however, all citizens of this country should have access to basic needs such as shelter.  therefore, it is the responsibility of all members of the country to sacrifice some in order to ensure the basic needs of all is met"
17,How would you describe the relationship between Crime and Support for Upzoning? Is it a strong or weak connection? Does it have a positive effect (increasing it) or a negative effect (decreasing it)? How strong is this effect?,"when upzoning occurs, I believe that crime will surely increase because low income housing almost certainly brings criminal behavior with it.  even if better housing is made available, lower income individuals tend to bring a criminal culture with them."
18,What causes changes in Support for Upzoning? Are these influences strong or weak?,perhaps when people experience empathy for those in need of housing they experience support for upzoning
19,How confident are you that changes in Low Income Families lead to changes in Support for Upzoning? Does it have a positive effect (increasing it) or a negative effect (decreasing it)? How strong is this effect?,"I am not confident that changes in Low Income Families lead to changes in support for upzoning.  Perhaps, hopefully it would have a positive effect."
20,"Would small changes in Lower housing costs lead to noticeable changes in Support for Upzoning, or would it take larger shifts? Does it have a positive effect (increasing it) or a negative effect (decreasing it)? How strong is this effect?","I do not believe that small changes would lead to noticeable changes in support for upzoning.  maybe, more substantial changes in housing costs would lead to more support for upzoning."
21,"Would small changes in Criminal culture lead to noticeable changes in Support for Upzoning, or would it take larger shifts? Does it have a positive effect (increasing it) or a negative effect (decreasing it)? How strong is this effect?",I believe that it would take large changes in criminal culture for people to increase support for upzoning
22,"Is the effect of Traffic Congestion on Support for Upzoning immediate, or does it take time to develop? Does it have a positive effect (increasing it) or a negative effect (decreasing it)? How strong is this effect?",traffic congestion would have an immediate negative effect for support for upzoning
23,"Does Considering Consequences have a positive or negative effect on Support for Upzoning, and how significant is this effect? Does it have a positive effect (increasing it) or a negative effect (decreasing it)? How strong is this effect?","considering consequences has a negative effect on support for upzoning.  for those living in the proposed neighborhood the effect is strongly negative, for those living outside the neighborhood the effect is mildly positive"
24,"Would small changes in Carbon output lead to noticeable changes in Support for Upzoning, or would it take larger shifts? Does it have a positive effect (increasing it) or a negative effect (decreasing it)? How strong is this effect?",I believe that it would take larger shifts in carbon output in order to have an effect either positive or negative on support for upzoning
25,How would you describe the relationship between Higher tax revenue and Support for Upzoning? Is it a strong or weak connection? Does it have a positive effect (increasing it) or a negative effect (decreasing it)? How strong is this effect?,"I believe that higher tax revenue would have a positive effect for support for upzoning from politicians and citizens at large, however, for current residents in the neighborhood, I do not believe that higher tax revenue will have any effect at all on their negative support for upzoning"
26,"Does Quality of life have a positive or negative effect on Support for Upzoning, and how significant is this effect? Does it have a positive effect (increasing it) or a negative effect (decreasing it)? How strong is this effect?","quality of life will bring empathy and positive support for upzoning from the community, however, the current residents in the neighborhood will consider their negative consequences as having more weight then their sympathy for future residents needs"
27,"Does Balancing interests have a positive or negative effect on Support for Upzoning, and how significant is this effect? Does it have a positive effect (increasing it) or a negative effect (decreasing it)? How strong is this effect?",I believe that balancing interests will have a positive effect on support for upzoning as many people will consider it fair for all individuals involved to give a little for the good of others.  the effect will be moderate
28,How confident are you that changes in Basic Needs lead to changes in Support for Upzoning? Does it have a positive effect (increasing it) or a negative effect (decreasing it)? How strong is this effect?,"I am fairly confident that when people realize that the basic need for shelter for people may be met through upzoning, many will people will support upzoning."

Does it have a positive effect (increasing it) or a negative effect (decreasing it)? How strong is this effect?",it will take larger shifts in criminal behavior in order to have a positive effect on support for upzoning

How strong is this effect?,I am fairly confident that changes in low income housing will lead to positive support for upzoning as long as those changes are substantial
31,"What do you think are the main causes of Higher density housing, and how certain are you about these relationships? Please also indicate if these influences are positive (increasing) or negative (decreasing).",my confidence level is certain
32,"What do you think are the main causes of Affordable Shelter, and how certain are you about these relationships? Please also indicate if these influences are positive (increasing) or negative (decreasing).",the interview continues to go to 100 percent than back down to 96 percent
