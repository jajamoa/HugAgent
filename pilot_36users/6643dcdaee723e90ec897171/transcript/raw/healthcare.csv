Question Number,Question,Answer
1,To what extent do you support or oppose universal healthcare policies that provide government-funded healthcare coverage for all citizens? Please explain your reasoning.,I am on the fence on this subject. I hear a lot how other countries have people waiting months to see specialist.
2,"What do you think are the most significant impacts, positive or negative, of implementing a universal healthcare system?","I think positive would be that many more people would actually get care from a regular physician and cancers and heart issues and diabetes would be caught sooner. Negative, there would be more people using the systems and they might get overrun and not prepared for the influx of people."
3,How do you think universal healthcare policies might affect healthcare quality and accessibility?,I think accessibility might get tougher to see specialists because there's so few of them and they would be able to find more issues faster. I think health care quality as far as what we're used to in the health care facilities would go downhill because they wouldn't be making as much money and they wouldn't care about bringing new patients in to make more money.
4,What impact do you believe a universal healthcare system might have on medical innovation and research?,This is where I'm not sure because there wouldn't be private companies funding research as much I don't think but I don't know I would hope that they still would
5,How do you think universal healthcare might affect the economic burden on individuals and families?,I think it would be a lot easier for families that had crises and the people that are going bankrupt trying to pay off their medical bills wouldn't have issues like that anymore. I think that causes more stress than the actual illnesses some people have.
6,What role do you believe government should play in healthcare delivery and financing?,"I don't think it's worked out very well having the government figure out how to make people pay for health care. I'm not sure there's anybody that has had a positive thing to say about that, so I'm not sure."
7,How might healthcare provider concerns factor into decisions about universal healthcare implementation?,Well I for one know that if I was under universal health care I would still want to pick my doctor. It's very important to have a good relationship with your doctor and if the government is picking out who's going to see what doctor that would not work out in America.
8,"What economic effects, both positive and negative, might result from transitioning to a universal healthcare system?",The positive side is that insurance companies would hopefully dissolve and fall apart and completely implode. It might be a negative effect that our taxes would go up with everybody having to pay for universal health care.
9,How do you think the interests of taxpayers versus healthcare consumers should be balanced when making healthcare policy?,"I feel like we're already paying insurance, our health insurance, every month and I would continue to pay that for universal health care and taxes but only if everybody else is too. I am not going to sit here and pay for everyone else's health care, if they can't afford it."
10,What role do you think social equity and access to care play in discussions about healthcare policy?,"I think everybody, no matter how much money they have, should have access to basic health care. Life-saving health care should be covered 100% from the government."
11,"Would small changes in Long wait times for specialists lead to noticeable changes in Support for universal healthcare, or would it take larger shifts? Does it have a positive effect (increasing it) or a negative effect (decreasing it)? How strong is this effect?","I think there's already problems waiting to see specialists and if we take away private insurance and universal health care steps in, any wait longer than what we're waiting now would definitely have a negative effect."
12,"What factors do you think influence Support for universal healthcare, and how strong is their impact? Please also indicate if these influences are positive (increasing) or negative (decreasing).","The factors that influence support for universal health care would be the rising costs of health care through private insurance firms and the hospitals overcharging, medications overcharging. I think it's a very very strong impact and I think that's where most of the people that support universal health care come from, the anger towards them."
13,How confident are you that changes in Early detection of serious illnesses lead to changes in Support for universal healthcare? Does it have a positive effect (increasing it) or a negative effect (decreasing it)? How strong is this effect?,"I think it's a positive effect that if we had universal healthcare and more people were going to the doctor because it was free, early detection would be a major positive thing."
14,"Does Medical innovation have a positive or negative effect on Support for universal healthcare, and how significant is this effect? Does it have a positive effect (increasing it) or a negative effect (decreasing it)? How strong is this effect?","If the government funding it would cause medical innovation to get better because it wouldn't be competitive, that would be positive. However, if private firms stopped paying to look into medical innovations and creating things because they weren't making money anymore, that would be very negative."
15,How would you describe the relationship between Economic burden and Support for universal healthcare? Is it a strong or weak connection? Does it have a positive effect (increasing it) or a negative effect (decreasing it)? How strong is this effect?,"Obviously it's a positive thing for the lower economic, but it's a negative thing for the people who would be paying more for the universal health care in their taxes. So it would be negative for them."
16,"Is the effect of Negative perception of government healthcare initiatives on Support for universal healthcare immediate, or does it take time to develop? Does it have a positive effect (increasing it) or a negative effect (decreasing it)? How strong is this effect?","I believe it would have a lot of people viewing it as negative in the beginning. I think, depending on how it developed, would say if it was going to be negative or positive. There's no way of knowing."
17,"Does Choice of doctor have a positive or negative effect on Support for universal healthcare, and how significant is this effect? Does it have a positive effect (increasing it) or a negative effect (decreasing it)? How strong is this effect?","I think it's a huge, huge effect. It would be a positive if people could choose their doctor. It would be a negative and people would be angry if they couldn't choose their doctor because that's how it has been here in the United States for a very long time and you can't go changing something like that."
18,How would you describe the relationship between Universal healthcare access and Support for universal healthcare? Is it a strong or weak connection? Does it have a positive effect (increasing it) or a negative effect (decreasing it)? How strong is this effect?,I'm not sure what the access and the support would be or how that would come about.
19,"Does Government-funded life-saving care have a positive or negative effect on Support for universal healthcare, and how significant is this effect? Does it have a positive effect (increasing it) or a negative effect (decreasing it)? How strong is this effect?",I think it has a positive effect. I think the government should definitely always fund life-saving care for anybody.
20,How would you describe the relationship between Negative effect on support and Support for universal healthcare? Is it a strong or weak connection? Does it have a positive effect (increasing it) or a negative effect (decreasing it)? How strong is this effect?,The relationship between the negative effect on support is a very negative effect.
21,What causes changes in Increased access to healthcare? Are these influences strong or weak?,"Changes in increased access to health care would be the government funding more stuff, more doctors, more regulations passed. I don't know."
22,"Would small changes in Medical innovation quality lead to noticeable changes in Support for universal healthcare, or would it take larger shifts? Does it have a positive effect (increasing it) or a negative effect (decreasing it)? How strong is this effect?","I don't think small changes would have any difference, positive or negative, to universal health care."
23,"Is the effect of Negative effect on higher contributors on Support for universal healthcare immediate, or does it take time to develop? Does it have a positive effect (increasing it) or a negative effect (decreasing it)? How strong is this effect?",If something negative happens to the higher contributors of supports for universal health care it would definitely immediately have a negative effect.
24,How would you describe the relationship between Positive effect on support for universal healthcare and Support for universal healthcare? Is it a strong or weak connection? Does it have a positive effect (increasing it) or a negative effect (decreasing it)? How strong is this effect?,Positive effects or support for universal health care would be great. It would be a very strong connection and would be good for it.
25,"Does Positive effect have a positive or negative effect on Support for universal healthcare, and how significant is this effect? Does it have a positive effect (increasing it) or a negative effect (decreasing it)? How strong is this effect?",This question does not make any sense.
26,How would you describe the relationship between Number of doctors and Support for universal healthcare? Is it a strong or weak connection? Does it have a positive effect (increasing it) or a negative effect (decreasing it)? How strong is this effect?,"The relationship between the number of doctors is very important for the support for universal health care because I've heard that we have less people going into doctors as a career and that would be bad because if more people are going to the doctor with universal health care, we would need more physicians."
27,How would you describe the relationship between Strength of the effect and Support for universal healthcare? Is it a strong or weak connection? Does it have a positive effect (increasing it) or a negative effect (decreasing it)? How strong is this effect?,The strength of the effect and support for universal health care is a strong connection as a positive effect and hopefully would work.
28,"Would small changes in Decrease in support lead to noticeable changes in Support for universal healthcare, or would it take larger shifts? Does it have a positive effect (increasing it) or a negative effect (decreasing it)? How strong is this effect?","I think small changes would be noticeable because anytime there's a negative thing towards universal health care, everybody jumps on it to use it as a point not to do it."
