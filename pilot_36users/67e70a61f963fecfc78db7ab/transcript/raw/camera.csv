We are one whole, one."
6,What role do you believe government should play in regulating surveillance technologies and data collection?,"I think we should have the government to train some people, just like police, like police patrol around the area, but you have some police patrol, you know, using, viewing the camera data."
7,How might technological concerns about accuracy and reliability factor into decisions about surveillance systems?,"We're not talking about like totally relying on it. We need to use a judgment. I mean, think about without a camera, you still have to make up your mind or try to determine, you know? So when we've more, just more evidence to consider, we're provided by this surveillance camera data, and it could be a good thing."
8,"What economic effects, both positive and negative, might result from investing in widespread surveillance infrastructure?","Pretty much stay the same, you know, I don't see it's negative and what positive."

So they are aware of it and I think it's just communication and once people get used to it, it shouldn't be a big deal because it's already, you know, the parts are put in effect in London I think and so far so good, no big deal and I think it helped."
10,What role do you think social equity and potential bias play in discussions about surveillance technologies?,"If you are a bad guy, you don't want it, if you are a good citizen, you probably want it for your own safe."

16,How confident are you that changes in Personal Privacy lead to changes in Support for surveillance camera? Does it have a positive effect (increasing it) or a negative effect (decreasing it)? How strong is this effect?,Changes in personal and private definitely would increase support for surveilling camera positively. And probably a lot for a lot of people.
17,"Is the effect of Community Trust on Support for surveillance camera immediate, or does it take time to develop?
