Question Number,Question,Answer
1,To what extent do you support or oppose the widespread deployment of surveillance cameras in public spaces? Please explain your reasoning.,"I somewhat support the use of surveillance cameras because they can improve public safety and help catch crimes. However, I’m concerned about privacy and the potential for misuse, so there should be clear rules and oversight."
2,"What do you think are the most significant impacts, positive or negative, of increasing surveillance camera coverage in urban areas?","Increasing surveillance can help reduce crime and make people feel safer, which is a big positive. On the downside, it can invade privacy and create distrust if people feel they’re being constantly watched."
3,How do you think surveillance technologies might affect public safety and crime rates?,"Surveillance technologies can lower crime rates by deterring illegal activity and helping catch offenders faster. But if not managed well, they might just push crime to less monitored areas without fully solving the problem."
4,What impact do you believe increased surveillance might have on personal privacy and individual liberties?,Increased surveillance can seriously threaten personal privacy by making people feel watched all the time. This might also limit individual freedoms if people start self-censoring their behavior out of fear.
5,How do you think surveillance camera systems might affect community trust and police-community relations?,Surveillance cameras could improve trust if they show police accountability and fairness. But they might also harm relationships if communities feel targeted or unfairly monitored.
6,What role do you believe government should play in regulating surveillance technologies and data collection?,The government should set clear rules to protect privacy and prevent abuse of surveillance data. They also need to ensure transparency and hold agencies accountable for how they use this technology.
7,How might technological concerns about accuracy and reliability factor into decisions about surveillance systems?,Concerns about accuracy are key because faulty or biased surveillance can lead to false accusations or unfair treatment. Reliable technology is crucial to maintain public trust and ensure the system works as intended.
8,"What economic effects, both positive and negative, might result from investing in widespread surveillance infrastructure?","Investing in surveillance can boost the security industry and create jobs, which is positive economically. On the downside, it can be costly to install and maintain, and if misused, might lead to legal challenges and public backlash."
9,How do you think the interests of law enforcement versus privacy advocates should be balanced when making surveillance policy?,I think there should be a balance where law enforcement gets the tools they need but with strict limits to protect privacy. Open dialogue and oversight can help ensure neither side’s interests overpower the other.
10,What role do you think social equity and potential bias play in discussions about surveillance technologies?,Social equity is crucial because surveillance can unfairly target marginalized communities if not carefully managed. Addressing potential bias in technology and enforcement helps ensure the system is fair and doesn’t deepen inequalities.
11,"Is the effect of Public safety on Support for surveillance camera immediate, or does it take time to develop? Does it have a positive effect (increasing it) or a negative effect (decreasing it)? How strong is this effect?","The effect of public safety on support for surveillance cameras is usually immediate and has a strong, positive effect. When people feel safer right away, they tend to back surveillance more quickly."
12,What causes changes in Support for surveillance camera? Are these influences strong or weak?,"Changes in support for surveillance cameras are caused mainly by perceived safety benefits, privacy concerns, and trust in authorities. These influences can be strong, especially when safety feels urgent or privacy feels threatened."
13,"Would small changes in Sense of safety lead to noticeable changes in Support for surveillance camera, or would it take larger shifts? Does it have a positive effect (increasing it) or a negative effect (decreasing it)? How strong is this effect?","Small changes in sense of safety can lead to noticeable increases in support for surveillance cameras. This effect is positive and moderately strong, as even slight improvements in feeling safe can boost backing for surveillance."
14,"Does Crime Rates have a positive or negative effect on Support for surveillance camera, and how significant is this effect? Does it have a positive effect (increasing it) or a negative effect (decreasing it)? How strong is this effect?","Higher crime rates have a positive effect on support for surveillance cameras, often increasing it. This effect is generally strong because people see cameras as a way to combat crime."
15,"Does Feeling watched have a positive or negative effect on Support for surveillance camera, and how significant is this effect? Does it have a positive effect (increasing it) or a negative effect (decreasing it)? How strong is this effect?","Feeling watched has a negative effect on support for surveillance cameras, decreasing it. This effect can be moderately strong since many people dislike the loss of privacy and constant monitoring."
16,How would you describe the relationship between Police accountability and Support for surveillance camera? Is it a strong or weak connection? Does it have a positive effect (increasing it) or a negative effect (decreasing it)? How strong is this effect?,"Police accountability has a strong, positive effect on support for surveillance cameras. When people trust that cameras will hold police accountable, they are more likely to support their use."
17,How confident are you that changes in Privacy protection lead to changes in Support for surveillance camera? Does it have a positive effect (increasing it) or a negative effect (decreasing it)? How strong is this effect?,I’m quite confident that better privacy protection leads to increased support for surveillance cameras. It has a positive effect that is moderately strong because people feel safer using these systems when their privacy is respected.
18,"Is the effect of False Accusations on Support for surveillance camera immediate, or does it take time to develop? Does it have a positive effect (increasing it) or a negative effect (decreasing it)? How strong is this effect?","The effect of false accusations on support for surveillance cameras usually takes time to develop. It has a negative effect, moderately strong, as concerns grow when people hear about wrongful targeting or errors over time."

People tend to support cameras more when they trust that clear rules protect privacy and prevent misuse.
21,"Would small changes in Fairness in surveillance systems lead to noticeable changes in Support for surveillance camera, or would it take larger shifts? Does it have a positive effect (increasing it) or a negative effect (decreasing it)? How strong is this effect?",Small changes in fairness in surveillance systems would likely lead to noticeable increases in support for surveillance cameras. This effect is positive and moderately strong because people value equitable treatment and bias reduction.
22,How would you describe the relationship between Support for Surveillance Cameras and Support for surveillance camera? Is it a strong or weak connection?

How strong is this effect?,"I’m quite confident that changes in Positive Effect lead to changes in Support for surveillance cameras. This factor has a positive effect—meaning as the perceived positive effects (like increased safety) grow, support for surveillance cameras increases. The strength of this effect is generally strong, since perceived benefits strongly influence public opinion on surveillance."
