So let's think about what happens if in a moderately wealthy area, they allowed low income housing in the name of \"equity\". For actual home owners (not renters), the value of their properties would go down.

So let's think about what happens if in a moderately wealthy area, they allowed low income housing in the name of \"equity\". For actual home owners (not renters), the value of their properties would go down.

So let's think about what happens if in a moderately wealthy area, they allowed low income housing in the name of \"equity\". For actual home owners (not renters), the value of their properties would go down.

I live in a big city and sometimes, the bus couldn't take all of us! That caused me to get late a couple of times since there wasn't even any standing room. So imagine, a rush of new low income people to this area, probably they don't have cars so they'll rely on buses, it'll just be extra strain on the buses and not everyone would be able to get on the bus at all."

So let's think about what happens if in a moderately wealthy area, they allowed low income housing in the name of \"equity\". For actual home owners (not renters), the value of their properties would go down. These are properties that they've worked for years to maintain, and suddenly, in the name of \"equity\", is it alright to allow the values to go down? No of course not!

Yes, they'll think it's \"decent\" to allow low income people to have low income housing in their community, BUT often, these people don't think about the consequences that would affect the people already living in the community.

      "answer": "That's definitely going to be a huge NEGATIVE right away. Nobody in their right mind would want themselves to be compromised for others. So let's think about what happens if in a moderately wealthy area, they allowed low income housing in the name of \"equity\". For actual home owners (not renters), the value of their properties would go down. These are properties that they've worked for years to maintain, and suddenly, in the name of \"equity\", is it alright to allow the values to go down? No of course not!

      "answer": "Of course \"Time\" will always have something to do with whether low income housing would be allowed or not. For example, maybe a politician would take his time forming some kind of bill concerning low income housing and he'll wait for enough public support before officially launching it in order to increase its chances of succeeding."

So let's think about what happens if in a moderately wealthy area, they allowed low income housing in the name of \"equity\". For actual home owners (not renters), the value of their properties would go down. These are properties that they've worked for years to maintain, and suddenly, in the name of \"equity\", is it alright to allow the values to go down? No of course not!

      "answer": "So, I think this significantly interrupts things. Of course, I'm thinking in terms of my own neighborhood, which I grew up in, and now after having returned from university, live in again, and it has always been single family neighborhoods in this whole area. I think there's an area with apartments further away, but it's the densest part of the city, and living there is kind of not the greatest. It's very stressful to try and find parking, and I know because I have friends that live there. Stores don't seem to be doing all that much better because so many more of them are open, so it kind of feels like the same thing, only it's just really hard to pick and choose where to go. I think that the biggest thing is it really would disrupt things. Change doesn't happen that rapidly. It happens very slowly, and those years of disruption would absolutely be very detrimental to the people living in this area, especially because there are lots of older people living here. So, I think that considering on a case-by-case basis, yes, there definitely are going to be some areas in which higher density housing would work, for instance, in bigger cities that already have higher density areas. But I think in even just generally urban, like not big cities, but like suburban areas, I do not think that it would work, and I would somewhat oppose it in those areas. Again, really dense areas like New York, Chicago, sure, I would support it, Atlanta. Cities where there genuinely is like overcapacity, like Phoenix maybe, but generally, I would not support it, no."

I think that the already existing businesses, which are doing just fine, would have a hard time competing with all the new ones that came in, maybe more modern ones. It kind of feels like, even though I know it's going to be more affordable, it somewhat feels like it's going to completely change the area, and it'll take a very long time for it to get back to normal. I think that those are the negative impacts. Positive, yes, rent would go down for sure. However, there are lots of places in which people don't rent their houses or apartments. So I think it would be really detrimental to property value, for instance, if people who own their houses, all of a sudden, they're going to be worth a lot less, it seems.

I worry about the kinds of people that might move in and worry that it might actually gentrify areas rather than make things more affordable. Of course I'm not very knowledgeable in what makes like a, there's a specific word for it, like a type of place where typically lower income people live, but even then I feel like making a specific part of the city like lower income can lead to a lot of problems like over-policing. I just don't see any real upsides to it. Even if things are made more affordable, I think that it's detrimental in many more areas that would definitely outtake that or overtake that."

However establishing public transportation in cities that don't Sounds Absolutely impossible. I know that in my city for instance. We do not have good public transportation like It's Seemingly impossible to the bus has never come in time People who are trying to commute to make it to things like school and work. It's just not going to work out There are plenty of people who opt to just walk to work because it's so much more viable Than to wait for the bus which is always late and overcrowded and has problems and delays I Think it would make it so much worse Significantly worse and congestion is already not great in cities that don't have big apartment complexes or Upzoning basically like here traffic is a nightmare in a lot of places because it's a city on the border So those border like the word to get to the border on the freeway is always ridiculously congested I can't imagine how terrible it would be. It would become like Los Angeles without even having that many people and There's no way we could establish Public transportation any more functionally without years and years of money and effort.

It is up to them to fix public transportation. It is up to them to figure out how to manage schools. It's up to them to figure out zoning, because the public does not have a responsibility to be doing that, especially if I think the public would be opposed to that here. Yeah, we have areas with apartments for sure, but those areas tend to be older. They have things that are already established.

I worry that there will be a lot more gasoline needed as well in these areas, because people are definitely going to need cars if they wanna get anywhere in time.

I assume that more local businesses might be able to open up, but the thing is, I don't think that they would be able to compete with monopolies like Walmart or Sam's Club. Things like that. I still do think that local businesses would be wiped out just as easily as they have been. So I can't see very many positives aside from more money going to corporations, which is not a positive in my opinion. I suppose maybe it might benefit something economically for the city, like tax-wise perhaps or something. I can't imagine what. I'm thinking very hard about this and it's taking me a while to think. I'm trying to think of positives. I suppose maybe more professionals would be able to afford living in the city and that could be a net positive and maybe that would have an economic effect, but I really can't think of many positives. I suppose maybe, like was said, rent might become lower, but even with that, property values would go down it would seem. I don't think there are very many positives. There are certainly more net negatives."

      "question": "How do you think the interests of current residents versus future residents should be balanced when making zoning decisions?",
      "answer": "I think the interests of current residents are certainly the most important. We cannot predict the future. We are not time travelers. Sure, we have people who are professionals who can look at patterns and think about how it might go, but we don't know that for certain. We should worry about the people who are living here now and their futures, not potential people who might be here someday. Because once we start thinking in hypotheticals, people are going to start thinking in the way that benefits them, and powerful people, in other words, typically richer people, are going to have more of a say in the future of places. So I think that it would not benefit the people who are already living somewhere to think of future residents' best interests. I think that we should absolutely highlight and focus on the struggles of current residents and their interests and what they need, because adding a bunch of extra people to something that's not entirely functioning just is a recipe for disaster."

      "question": "What role do you think social equity and access to opportunity play in discussions about zoning and housing policy?",
      "answer": "Here it certainly gets more complicated in that yes, definitely people who can't afford to live somewhere need a place that's low income to live. I just don't think that that should be upzoning. I think that yes, low income housing should be established for sure. It would be very helpful. However, doing that in places that already have an established pattern, that already have an established presence, is detrimental to those places and to those people. It's not going to work. However, of course social equity plays a big amount and of course people have a right to have a place to live. People have a right to shelter, a right to food, a right to water, a right to the internet, a right to electricity. And upzoning areas that are already existing will not do that for them. I don't think so. It'll make everything harder for everybody. When it comes to social equity, I think it has everything to do with it and I think everybody deserves equal opportunity, which they won't get if we just start adding low income housing to areas that are already pre-existing. Areas need to be dictated for that or given for that. Again, very ideally by local government to see what would work the best. Perhaps in expanding cities, for instance, where they can build new schools or bigger schools or focus on an area that can be improved."

      "answer": "This question is a little confusing, so I need to take some time to talk through it and think about it. I think that larger shifts would be very detrimental to the population and the economy and just generally everything here. At least here in my city, I'm considering it from a bigger lens as best I can. I think that smaller changes would probably lead for more support or rather less negativity. I think that if things happened very fast, the negative changes would be very noticeable. Whereas if things happened in very little ways and slowly, perhaps the cities would be able to manage it better and the areas might be able to develop in time. And perhaps people won't realize things are getting worse if they do as quickly. Because people are able to turn a blind eye to things as long as they are doing okay a lot of the time. So it's like people might be blissfully ignorant if it's not affecting them. Whereas if there are these big things, then there will be a lot of people talking about it all at once very vocally and more people will be aware of it. So I think the less people that are aware, the less of an effect it will have generally."

I understand that we do need areas for development, like choose specific areas for lower income housing, for new apartment buildings are affordable. But I can't see anybody wanting things to change like that. I can't see any of the neighborhoods nearby being able to function even remotely with that sort of change. I can't see any of the schools being able to handle it. All I can envision are angry parents with how the schools are going. I can consider angry older residents or distressed older residents with how much everything is changing. I can imagine shops dealing with new competition they haven't dealt with before, ones that are barely staying afloat compared to things like Walmart. I think that disruption is one of the biggest effects and probably the thing people would be the most against or feel the most strong about."

      "answer": "I think it's a significantly strong connection and something that we should think about. It definitely has a negative effect on how I would feel about upzoning because, for instance, my parents are in their late 60s to early 80s, like they are older. I can't see them being able to function that way. I can't see any of where the businesses they used to work at, I can't see that working. I understand that it's important for people to adapt, but I don't think people should have to adapt that significantly, especially in areas that are already established where people have owned homes for over 40, 50 years even. I don't think it's fair to shift things that significantly in established neighbourhoods, old local businesses that have somehow survived things like COVID and monopolies rising, corporations. It doesn't feel fair and it has a very strong effect on me and the way that I feel about it. I assume it would have a very strong effect on them and a very strong effect on their relatives, even relatives living elsewhere. Houses, even single family houses, are already crowded a lot of the time. It's a big family living in one house and the areas are crowded, the schools are crowded, the workplaces, it's already so hard to find a job. I can't see that many, I can't see it working. I can't see it being remotely beneficial for older people."

For instance, how fast it is, or how slow it is, or how quick, you know, just like how, how little or big the changes are, what, what's put in place to deal with it, how infrastructure changes, if we can work with transportation, that's like a limitless answer.

      "answer": "It's definitely a strong effect. And in areas where most people rent, it would be very beneficial. But in areas where most people own their houses, it has a negative effect. So it really just depends. It's a very strong effect in either a really good or a really bad way, depending on where this happens. In areas where most people rent, yes, upzoning would be great. It would make rent less for those people. And again, maybe it'll make property tax less in other areas, like family-owned houses, things like that. But it would also decrease the value of their property. So yeah, affordability kind of has everything to do with it. I think the biggest benefit would be being able to, for poorer people, for people of lower income, to afford a place to live. That's what's necessary. But we can't do it at the detriment of other people who are already established, because it would just lead to so many problems for everybody, including the low-income people moving in.

There's already an energy to it if that makes sense there's already something that people are used to and Change is not something very many people can adapt to very easily like yes We can adapt eventually, but is it something easy to adapt to absolutely not I? Think it would have a rather negative effect I can't see how adding an apartment complex for instance to an Area where there are pretty much just single-family houses Wouldn't not be totally out of place and have this sort of like new Congestion of traffic and new things opening up and everything changing I think the biggest issue is change and that does have a negative effect on things"

      "answer": "Oh, the effect of public transportation is absolutely immediate. It would be terrible. It absolutely takes time to develop a transportation system that works for adding so many new people to an area, especially if the point is to give lower income people a way to exist, a way to thrive. How would they do that without efficient public transportation? It would have an extremely negative effect because either they're going to have to figure out how to get a car. They're going to have to figure out a way to walk to where they need to be for work. They're going to have to figure out a way to walk to school because even the school bus system is out of whack in the area. There's going to have to be so much more. It's going to take so long to develop this. If it were to happen immediately, there would be absolutely no hope.

      "answer": "I mean, a lot of people are blind to environmental concerns to begin with, while it's very important to me, I think it would be the last thing on everybody else's mind for most people's minds. I'm not generalizing here. I think it would be the last thing on people's mind, unfortunately. I would say it has a negative effect. I can't see it having a positive effect of any kind. It's not like more people has ever led to the environment becoming better in human history. To environmentalists, it would certainly decrease support. To general people, I don't think it would have an effect at all. So depending on the person and their morals and how much they care about ethicality and environmental protection, it either is a very strong effect in the negative sense, or for unfortunately, probably the majority or at least a very fair amount of people, it's not going to be something that they think about compared to all the other problems."

I would have the same answer as I did to the last question because to me these two answers are tied in. Natural gases are something that we expend and that we are eventually going to run out of and that's always been the case and people don't think about it or consider it. So yes, I think same answer.

I'm just saying in regards to monopolies that corporations like Walmart, Sam's, things that have already monopolized the industry, they exist and they're already rooting out small businesses. So I don't see how people coming in and opening up new small locally owned businesses would be beneficial to themselves because they might easily be like purged out or like culled by the big corporations in every city or they would just potentially become competition to the already existing and already struggling locally owned businesses that are here. That's what I meant by monopolies."

I think that's what I meant by that current residents interest is solving the current issues is necessary before we add more people to an area that's already dysfunctional or a city that's already dysfunctional. Things needs to be in a stable place before adding even more instability to it.

They have a right to survive, a right to electricity, a right to warmth, a right to the internet these days with the way things work. Everyone has their basic human rights. And of course, giving people a place to live is important. I would say that would have a positive effect on the idea of upzoning because it's the only big benefit that I could see and I'm sure a lot of people could see is it would give people who can't afford a place to live and make affording to live easier for people who are struggling. So it's a very strong effect. It's the one big positive that exists in all this."

I mean, I feel like as long as areas where, if already pre-established areas where lots of people who have been living here for a long time live remain untouched, that might lead to more support. But if negative changes happen to them, if things change in their lives and there's more chaos and change added to it, then that would be a negative effect. And it would be pretty strong either way.

So it's very hard already to deal with how many kids are in so many schools that already exist here. Adding even more to a certain area would totally overflow the school system. Like there would be no way to give attention to the kids who need it. There would be no way to have enough teachers. The classes are already so big, the sizes of the classes, I mean. And it would be immediate, especially if many people move in all at once. It would be a very negative effect. And I would say it's pretty strong. And this would be detrimental to both angry parents and kids who are not getting a proper education to begin with. It's such a poor school system already.

      "answer": "I don't really understand this question either. The main cause of single-family neighborhoods are just that they were already pre-established to begin with. In the past, homes used to be affordable, so it made sense to live the typical quote-unquote American dream and get your white picket fence little home with a single earner earning all the income for a family and being able to support a family of four on just one income. That's not possible anymore. So I would say that the cause of single-family neighborhoods is a time before everything was as ridiculously priced as it is now. It's not feasible anymore, but it used to be at least somewhat feasible in the past. Now it's basically impossible to be able to do that. So the cause of it is just it's pre-established. It already existed decades and decades ago. I would say that these influences just are. I don't think it's a positive or negative influence on cities. I think that it's nice to have areas like that. It's certainly incredibly expensive to live there, and rent is impossible to afford there, but I don't think that adding to those neighborhoods something that will decrease them in value is beneficial to anybody.

      "answer": "So, I think this significantly interrupts things. Of course, I'm thinking in terms of my own neighborhood, which I grew up in, and now after having returned from university, live in again, and it has always been single family neighborhoods in this whole area. I think there's an area with apartments further away, but it's the densest part of the city, and living there is kind of not the greatest. It's very stressful to try and find parking, and I know because I have friends that live there. Stores don't seem to be doing all that much better because so many more of them are open, so it kind of feels like the same thing, only it's just really hard to pick and choose where to go. I think that the biggest thing is it really would disrupt things. Change doesn't happen that rapidly. It happens very slowly, and those years of disruption would absolutely be very detrimental to the people living in this area, especially because there are lots of older people living here. So, I think that considering on a case-by-case basis, yes, there definitely are going to be some areas in which higher density housing would work, for instance, in bigger cities that already have higher density areas. But I think in even just generally urban, like not big cities, but like suburban areas, I do not think that it would work, and I would somewhat oppose it in those areas. Again, really dense areas like New York, Chicago, sure, I would support it, Atlanta. Cities where there genuinely is like overcapacity, like Phoenix maybe, but generally, I would not support it, no."

It kind of feels like, even though I know it's going to be more affordable, it somewhat feels like it's going to completely change the area, and it'll take a very long time for it to get back to normal. I think that those are the negative impacts. Positive, yes, rent would go down for sure. However, there are lots of places in which people don't rent their houses or apartments. So I think it would be really detrimental to property value, for instance, if people who own their houses, all of a sudden, they're going to be worth a lot less, it seems.

Like, even if one apartment complex was built in the area that I live in, for instance, the schools nearby would not be able to handle that. They're already at capacity. The city would need to be able to afford to accommodate very many more people, for one, because I'm sure people would move to places where it's more affordable. That's what always happens. I feel like quality of life would definitely go down. Again, there are some areas where lots of older people live, and having droves of new people come in and disrupt the flow of things the way that they are is extremely detrimental to people who have lived the same way for very many years. And while I understand that adaptability is important, and people should be able to adapt for the greater good, I don't see this as the greater good. I think that it would take years and years of the city's infrastructure changing in order to accommodate this, and it would be completely detrimental in the meanwhile, in those years of transition.

However establishing public transportation in cities that don't Sounds Absolutely impossible. I know that in my city for instance. We do not have good public transportation like It's Seemingly impossible to the bus has never come in time People who are trying to commute to make it to things like school and work. It's just not going to work out There are plenty of people who opt to just walk to work because it's so much more viable Than to wait for the bus which is always late and overcrowded and has problems and delays I Think it would make it so much worse Significantly worse and congestion is already not great in cities that don't have big apartment complexes or Upzoning basically like here traffic is a nightmare in a lot of places because it's a city on the border So those border like the word to get to the border on the freeway is always ridiculously congested I can't imagine how terrible it would be. It would become like Los Angeles without even having that many people and There's no way we could establish Public transportation any more functionally without years and years of money and effort.

It's up to them to figure out zoning, because the public does not have a responsibility to be doing that, especially if I think the public would be opposed to that here.

      "question": "What economic effects, both positive and negative, might result from changing zoning laws to allow more multi-family housing?",
      "answer": "This I'm less versed in. I don't understand what specific effects might happen, but I can make a couple of guesses maybe. I assume that more local businesses might be able to open up, but the thing is, I don't think that they would be able to compete with monopolies like Walmart or Sam's Club. Things like that. I still do think that local businesses would be wiped out just as easily as they have been. So I can't see very many positives aside from more money going to corporations, which is not a positive in my opinion. I suppose maybe it might benefit something economically for the city, like tax-wise perhaps or something. I can't imagine what. I'm thinking very hard about this and it's taking me a while to think. I'm trying to think of positives. I suppose maybe more professionals would be able to afford living in the city and that could be a net positive and maybe that would have an economic effect, but I really can't think of many positives. I suppose maybe, like was said, rent might become lower, but even with that, property values would go down it would seem. I don't think there are very many positives. There are certainly more net negatives."

      "question": "How do you think the interests of current residents versus future residents should be balanced when making zoning decisions?",
      "answer": "I think the interests of current residents are certainly the most important. We cannot predict the future. We are not time travelers. Sure, we have people who are professionals who can look at patterns and think about how it might go, but we don't know that for certain. We should worry about the people who are living here now and their futures, not potential people who might be here someday. Because once we start thinking in hypotheticals, people are going to start thinking in the way that benefits them, and powerful people, in other words, typically richer people, are going to have more of a say in the future of places. So I think that it would not benefit the people who are already living somewhere to think of future residents' best interests. I think that we should absolutely highlight and focus on the struggles of current residents and their interests and what they need, because adding a bunch of extra people to something that's not entirely functioning just is a recipe for disaster."

      "question": "What role do you think social equity and access to opportunity play in discussions about zoning and housing policy?",
      "answer": "Here it certainly gets more complicated in that yes, definitely people who can't afford to live somewhere need a place that's low income to live. I just don't think that that should be upzoning. I think that yes, low income housing should be established for sure. It would be very helpful. However, doing that in places that already have an established pattern, that already have an established presence, is detrimental to those places and to those people. It's not going to work. However, of course social equity plays a big amount and of course people have a right to have a place to live. People have a right to shelter, a right to food, a right to water, a right to the internet, a right to electricity. And upzoning areas that are already existing will not do that for them. I don't think so. It'll make everything harder for everybody. When it comes to social equity, I think it has everything to do with it and I think everybody deserves equal opportunity, which they won't get if we just start adding low income housing to areas that are already pre-existing. Areas need to be dictated for that or given for that. Again, very ideally by local government to see what would work the best. Perhaps in expanding cities, for instance, where they can build new schools or bigger schools or focus on an area that can be improved."

      "answer": "This question is a little confusing, so I need to take some time to talk through it and think about it. I think that larger shifts would be very detrimental to the population and the economy and just generally everything here. At least here in my city, I'm considering it from a bigger lens as best I can. I think that smaller changes would probably lead for more support or rather less negativity. I think that if things happened very fast, the negative changes would be very noticeable. Whereas if things happened in very little ways and slowly, perhaps the cities would be able to manage it better and the areas might be able to develop in time. And perhaps people won't realize things are getting worse if they do as quickly. Because people are able to turn a blind eye to things as long as they are doing okay a lot of the time. So it's like people might be blissfully ignorant if it's not affecting them. Whereas if there are these big things, then there will be a lot of people talking about it all at once very vocally and more people will be aware of it. So I think the less people that are aware, the less of an effect it will have generally."

      "answer": "Disruption to community has an extremely negative effect on support for upzoning. And I think it is very, very significant. I can't see anybody wanting things to change in that way. I understand that we do need areas for development, like choose specific areas for lower income housing, for new apartment buildings are affordable. But I can't see anybody wanting things to change like that. I can't see any of the neighborhoods nearby being able to function even remotely with that sort of change. I can't see any of the schools being able to handle it. All I can envision are angry parents with how the schools are going. I can consider angry older residents or distressed older residents with how much everything is changing. I can imagine shops dealing with new competition they haven't dealt with before, ones that are barely staying afloat compared to things like Walmart. I think that disruption is one of the biggest effects and probably the thing people would be the most against or feel the most strong about."

      "answer": "I think it's a significantly strong connection and something that we should think about. It definitely has a negative effect on how I would feel about upzoning because, for instance, my parents are in their late 60s to early 80s, like they are older. I can't see them being able to function that way. I can't see any of where the businesses they used to work at, I can't see that working. I understand that it's important for people to adapt, but I don't think people should have to adapt that significantly, especially in areas that are already established where people have owned homes for over 40, 50 years even. I don't think it's fair to shift things that significantly in established neighbourhoods, old local businesses that have somehow survived things like COVID and monopolies rising, corporations. It doesn't feel fair and it has a very strong effect on me and the way that I feel about it. I assume it would have a very strong effect on them and a very strong effect on their relatives, even relatives living elsewhere. Houses, even single family houses, are already crowded a lot of the time. It's a big family living in one house and the areas are crowded, the schools are crowded, the workplaces, it's already so hard to find a job. I can't see that many, I can't see it working. I can't see it being remotely beneficial for older people."

For instance, how fast it is, or how slow it is, or how quick, you know, just like how, how little or big the changes are, what, what's put in place to deal with it, how infrastructure changes, if we can work with transportation, that's like a limitless answer.

      "answer": "It's definitely a strong effect. And in areas where most people rent, it would be very beneficial. But in areas where most people own their houses, it has a negative effect. So it really just depends. It's a very strong effect in either a really good or a really bad way, depending on where this happens. In areas where most people rent, yes, upzoning would be great. It would make rent less for those people. And again, maybe it'll make property tax less in other areas, like family-owned houses, things like that. But it would also decrease the value of their property. So yeah, affordability kind of has everything to do with it. I think the biggest benefit would be being able to, for poorer people, for people of lower income, to afford a place to live. That's what's necessary. But we can't do it at the detriment of other people who are already established, because it would just lead to so many problems for everybody, including the low-income people moving in.

There's already an energy to it if that makes sense there's already something that people are used to and Change is not something very many people can adapt to very easily like yes We can adapt eventually, but is it something easy to adapt to absolutely not I? Think it would have a rather negative effect I can't see how adding an apartment complex for instance to an Area where there are pretty much just single-family houses Wouldn't not be totally out of place and have this sort of like new Congestion of traffic and new things opening up and everything changing I think the biggest issue is change and that does have a negative effect on things"

      "answer": "Oh, the effect of public transportation is absolutely immediate. It would be terrible. It absolutely takes time to develop a transportation system that works for adding so many new people to an area, especially if the point is to give lower income people a way to exist, a way to thrive. How would they do that without efficient public transportation? It would have an extremely negative effect because either they're going to have to figure out how to get a car. They're going to have to figure out a way to walk to where they need to be for work. They're going to have to figure out a way to walk to school because even the school bus system is out of whack in the area. There's going to have to be so much more. It's going to take so long to develop this. If it were to happen immediately, there would be absolutely no hope. It has an extremely negative impact unless the city already has an established and efficient public transportation system."

      "answer": "I mean, a lot of people are blind to environmental concerns to begin with, while it's very important to me, I think it would be the last thing on everybody else's mind for most people's minds. I'm not generalizing here. I think it would be the last thing on people's mind, unfortunately. I would say it has a negative effect. I can't see it having a positive effect of any kind. It's not like more people has ever led to the environment becoming better in human history. To environmentalists, it would certainly decrease support. To general people, I don't think it would have an effect at all. So depending on the person and their morals and how much they care about ethicality and environmental protection, it either is a very strong effect in the negative sense, or for unfortunately, probably the majority or at least a very fair amount of people, it's not going to be something that they think about compared to all the other problems."

I would have the same answer as I did to the last question because to me these two answers are tied in. Natural gases are something that we expend and that we are eventually going to run out of and that's always been the case and people don't think about it or consider it. So yes, I think same answer. Depending on how environmentally ethical you are, it either has a strong negative effect or other people won't even think about it."

      "answer": "I don't understand what changes in monopolies means. I'm just saying in regards to monopolies that corporations like Walmart, Sam's, things that have already monopolized the industry, they exist and they're already rooting out small businesses. So I don't see how people coming in and opening up new small locally owned businesses would be beneficial to themselves because they might easily be like purged out or like culled by the big corporations in every city or they would just potentially become competition to the already existing and already struggling locally owned businesses that are here. That's what I meant by monopolies."

      "answer": "I mean I feel like if current residents had less things to strive for or hope for or changes that they would need then perhaps it would be easier to accept upzoning. I think that's what I meant by that current residents interest is solving the current issues is necessary before we add more people to an area that's already dysfunctional or a city that's already dysfunctional. Things needs to be in a stable place before adding even more instability to it. So I would say it has a pretty strong effect because content people are more likely to accept change than people who are already having a hard time or are already angry about something."

They have a right to survive, a right to electricity, a right to warmth, a right to the internet these days with the way things work. Everyone has their basic human rights. And of course, giving people a place to live is important. I would say that would have a positive effect on the idea of upzoning because it's the only big benefit that I could see and I'm sure a lot of people could see is it would give people who can't afford a place to live and make affording to live easier for people who are struggling. So it's a very strong effect. It's the one big positive that exists in all this."

I mean, I feel like as long as areas where, if already pre-established areas where lots of people who have been living here for a long time live remain untouched, that might lead to more support. But if negative changes happen to them, if things change in their lives and there's more chaos and change added to it, then that would be a negative effect. And it would be pretty strong either way. So again, not a super clear question, but that's the answer I think I can give."

      "answer": "Oh, this is for sure an immediate concern. Schools are already really full and there are not enough teachers generally all over the nation. So it's very hard already to deal with how many kids are in so many schools that already exist here. Adding even more to a certain area would totally overflow the school system. Like there would be no way to give attention to the kids who need it. There would be no way to have enough teachers. The classes are already so big, the sizes of the classes, I mean. And it would be immediate, especially if many people move in all at once. It would be a very negative effect. And I would say it's pretty strong. And this would be detrimental to both angry parents and kids who are not getting a proper education to begin with. It's such a poor school system already. Adding even more weights to something that's breaking is not going to be efficient or effective or good."

      "answer": "I don't really understand this question either. The main cause of single-family neighborhoods are just that they were already pre-established to begin with. In the past, homes used to be affordable, so it made sense to live the typical quote-unquote American dream and get your white picket fence little home with a single earner earning all the income for a family and being able to support a family of four on just one income. That's not possible anymore. So I would say that the cause of single-family neighborhoods is a time before everything was as ridiculously priced as it is now. It's not feasible anymore, but it used to be at least somewhat feasible in the past. Now it's basically impossible to be able to do that. So the cause of it is just it's pre-established. It already existed decades and decades ago. I would say that these influences just are. I don't think it's a positive or negative influence on cities. I think that it's nice to have areas like that. It's certainly incredibly expensive to live there, and rent is impossible to afford there, but I don't think that adding to those neighborhoods something that will decrease them in value is beneficial to anybody.

      "answer": "So, I think this significantly interrupts things. Of course, I'm thinking in terms of my own neighborhood, which I grew up in, and now after having returned from university, live in again, and it has always been single family neighborhoods in this whole area. I think there's an area with apartments further away, but it's the densest part of the city, and living there is kind of not the greatest. It's very stressful to try and find parking, and I know because I have friends that live there. Stores don't seem to be doing all that much better because so many more of them are open, so it kind of feels like the same thing, only it's just really hard to pick and choose where to go. I think that the biggest thing is it really would disrupt things. Change doesn't happen that rapidly. It happens very slowly, and those years of disruption would absolutely be very detrimental to the people living in this area, especially because there are lots of older people living here. So, I think that considering on a case-by-case basis, yes, there definitely are going to be some areas in which higher density housing would work, for instance, in bigger cities that already have higher density areas. But I think in even just generally urban, like not big cities, but like suburban areas, I do not think that it would work, and I would somewhat oppose it in those areas. Again, really dense areas like New York, Chicago, sure, I would support it, Atlanta. Cities where there genuinely is like overcapacity, like Phoenix maybe, but generally, I would not support it, no."

It kind of feels like, even though I know it's going to be more affordable, it somewhat feels like it's going to completely change the area, and it'll take a very long time for it to get back to normal. I think that those are the negative impacts. Positive, yes, rent would go down for sure. However, there are lots of places in which people don't rent their houses or apartments. So I think it would be really detrimental to property value, for instance, if people who own their houses, all of a sudden, they're going to be worth a lot less, it seems.

I worry about the kinds of people that might move in and worry that it might actually gentrify areas rather than make things more affordable. Of course I'm not very knowledgeable in what makes like a, there's a specific word for it, like a type of place where typically lower income people live, but even then I feel like making a specific part of the city like lower income can lead to a lot of problems like over-policing. I just don't see any real upsides to it. Even if things are made more affordable, I think that it's detrimental in many more areas that would definitely outtake that or overtake that."

It feels like having far more people in an area that is not ready for that, there would have to be such an insane change of infrastructure. Like, even if one apartment complex was built in the area that I live in, for instance, the schools nearby would not be able to handle that. They're already at capacity. The city would need to be able to afford to accommodate very many more people, for one, because I'm sure people would move to places where it's more affordable. That's what always happens. I feel like quality of life would definitely go down. Again, there are some areas where lots of older people live, and having droves of new people come in and disrupt the flow of things the way that they are is extremely detrimental to people who have lived the same way for very many years. And while I understand that adaptability is important, and people should be able to adapt for the greater good, I don't see this as the greater good. I think that it would take years and years of the city's infrastructure changing in order to accommodate this, and it would be completely detrimental in the meanwhile, in those years of transition. And even then, there's no guaranteeing the city would come out for the better because of it. Neighborhood in particular, yeah, it would be absolutely horrific for several years, maybe even a decade or so. I don't think it's worth it."

However establishing public transportation in cities that don't Sounds Absolutely impossible. I know that in my city for instance. We do not have good public transportation like It's Seemingly impossible to the bus has never come in time People who are trying to commute to make it to things like school and work. It's just not going to work out There are plenty of people who opt to just walk to work because it's so much more viable Than to wait for the bus which is always late and overcrowded and has problems and delays I Think it would make it so much worse Significantly worse and congestion is already not great in cities that don't have big apartment complexes or Upzoning basically like here traffic is a nightmare in a lot of places because it's a city on the border So those border like the word to get to the border on the freeway is always ridiculously congested I can't imagine how terrible it would be. It would become like Los Angeles without even having that many people and There's no way we could establish Public transportation any more functionally without years and years of money and effort.

It's up to them to figure out zoning, because the public does not have a responsibility to be doing that, especially if I think the public would be opposed to that here. Yeah, we have areas with apartments for sure, but those areas tend to be older. They have things that are already established. It would be totally up to local government to establish new things, not just the general public. I don't understand how it would be up to them."

      "answer": "Oh, I am significantly concerned about that. Already trying to get resources for like the general population of a city, like things like the natural gases that you would need, things for energy, electricity, power. I think that upzoning would absolutely be detrimental to the environment, yes. Now that I didn't even consider that, now that I'm thinking about it, that sounds horrific. I worry that there will be a lot more gasoline needed as well in these areas, because people are definitely going to need cars if they wanna get anywhere in time. The oil, the electricity, the water that would be needed even, just it doesn't sound like it would be beneficial to the planet or the people."

      "question": "What economic effects, both positive and negative, might result from changing zoning laws to allow more multi-family housing?",
      "answer": "This I'm less versed in. I don't understand what specific effects might happen, but I can make a couple of guesses maybe. I assume that more local businesses might be able to open up, but the thing is, I don't think that they would be able to compete with monopolies like Walmart or Sam's Club. Things like that. I still do think that local businesses would be wiped out just as easily as they have been. So I can't see very many positives aside from more money going to corporations, which is not a positive in my opinion. I suppose maybe it might benefit something economically for the city, like tax-wise perhaps or something. I can't imagine what. I'm thinking very hard about this and it's taking me a while to think. I'm trying to think of positives. I suppose maybe more professionals would be able to afford living in the city and that could be a net positive and maybe that would have an economic effect, but I really can't think of many positives. I suppose maybe, like was said, rent might become lower, but even with that, property values would go down it would seem. I don't think there are very many positives. There are certainly more net negatives."

      "question": "How do you think the interests of current residents versus future residents should be balanced when making zoning decisions?",
      "answer": "I think the interests of current residents are certainly the most important. We cannot predict the future. We are not time travelers. Sure, we have people who are professionals who can look at patterns and think about how it might go, but we don't know that for certain. We should worry about the people who are living here now and their futures, not potential people who might be here someday. Because once we start thinking in hypotheticals, people are going to start thinking in the way that benefits them, and powerful people, in other words, typically richer people, are going to have more of a say in the future of places. So I think that it would not benefit the people who are already living somewhere to think of future residents' best interests. I think that we should absolutely highlight and focus on the struggles of current residents and their interests and what they need, because adding a bunch of extra people to something that's not entirely functioning just is a recipe for disaster."

      "question_number": "10",
      "question": "What role do you think social equity and access to opportunity play in discussions about zoning and housing policy?",
      "answer": "Here it certainly gets more complicated in that yes, definitely people who can't afford to live somewhere need a place that's low income to live. I just don't think that that should be upzoning. I think that yes, low income housing should be established for sure. It would be very helpful. However, doing that in places that already have an established pattern, that already have an established presence, is detrimental to those places and to those people. It's not going to work. However, of course social equity plays a big amount and of course people have a right to have a place to live. People have a right to shelter, a right to food, a right to water, a right to the internet, a right to electricity. And upzoning areas that are already existing will not do that for them. I don't think so. It'll make everything harder for everybody. When it comes to social equity, I think it has everything to do with it and I think everybody deserves equal opportunity, which they won't get if we just start adding low income housing to areas that are already pre-existing. Areas need to be dictated for that or given for that. Again, very ideally by local government to see what would work the best. Perhaps in expanding cities, for instance, where they can build new schools or bigger schools or focus on an area that can be improved."

      "answer": "This question is a little confusing, so I need to take some time to talk through it and think about it. I think that larger shifts would be very detrimental to the population and the economy and just generally everything here. At least here in my city, I'm considering it from a bigger lens as best I can. I think that smaller changes would probably lead for more support or rather less negativity. I think that if things happened very fast, the negative changes would be very noticeable. Whereas if things happened in very little ways and slowly, perhaps the cities would be able to manage it better and the areas might be able to develop in time. And perhaps people won't realize things are getting worse if they do as quickly. Because people are able to turn a blind eye to things as long as they are doing okay a lot of the time. So it's like people might be blissfully ignorant if it's not affecting them. Whereas if there are these big things, then there will be a lot of people talking about it all at once very vocally and more people will be aware of it. So I think the less people that are aware, the less of an effect it will have generally."

      "answer": "Disruption to community has an extremely negative effect on support for upzoning. And I think it is very, very significant. I can't see anybody wanting things to change in that way. I understand that we do need areas for development, like choose specific areas for lower income housing, for new apartment buildings are affordable. But I can't see anybody wanting things to change like that. I can't see any of the neighborhoods nearby being able to function even remotely with that sort of change. I can't see any of the schools being able to handle it. All I can envision are angry parents with how the schools are going. I can consider angry older residents or distressed older residents with how much everything is changing. I can imagine shops dealing with new competition they haven't dealt with before, ones that are barely staying afloat compared to things like Walmart. I think that disruption is one of the biggest effects and probably the thing people would be the most against or feel the most strong about."

      "answer": "I think it's a significantly strong connection and something that we should think about. It definitely has a negative effect on how I would feel about upzoning because, for instance, my parents are in their late 60s to early 80s, like they are older. I can't see them being able to function that way. I can't see any of where the businesses they used to work at, I can't see that working. I understand that it's important for people to adapt, but I don't think people should have to adapt that significantly, especially in areas that are already established where people have owned homes for over 40, 50 years even. I don't think it's fair to shift things that significantly in established neighbourhoods, old local businesses that have somehow survived things like COVID and monopolies rising, corporations. It doesn't feel fair and it has a very strong effect on me and the way that I feel about it. I assume it would have a very strong effect on them and a very strong effect on their relatives, even relatives living elsewhere. Houses, even single family houses, are already crowded a lot of the time. It's a big family living in one house and the areas are crowded, the schools are crowded, the workplaces, it's already so hard to find a job. I can't see that many, I can't see it working. I can't see it being remotely beneficial for older people."

      "answer": "think that I've been pretty clear on what causes changes in support. For instance, how fast it is, or how slow it is, or how quick, you know, just like how, how little or big the changes are, what, what's put in place to deal with it, how infrastructure changes, if we can work with transportation, that's like a limitless answer.

      "answer": "It's definitely a strong effect. And in areas where most people rent, it would be very beneficial. But in areas where most people own their houses, it has a negative effect. So it really just depends. It's a very strong effect in either a really good or a really bad way, depending on where this happens. In areas where most people rent, yes, upzoning would be great. It would make rent less for those people. And again, maybe it'll make property tax less in other areas, like family-owned houses, things like that. But it would also decrease the value of their property. So yeah, affordability kind of has everything to do with it. I think the biggest benefit would be being able to, for poorer people, for people of lower income, to afford a place to live. That's what's necessary. But we can't do it at the detriment of other people who are already established, because it would just lead to so many problems for everybody, including the low-income people moving in. It's unfortunate."

There's already an energy to it if that makes sense there's already something that people are used to and Change is not something very many people can adapt to very easily like yes We can adapt eventually, but is it something easy to adapt to absolutely not I? Think it would have a rather negative effect I can't see how adding an apartment complex for instance to an Area where there are pretty much just single-family houses Wouldn't not be totally out of place and have this sort of like new Congestion of traffic and new things opening up and everything changing I think the biggest issue is change and that does have a negative effect on things"

      "answer": "Oh, the effect of public transportation is absolutely immediate. It would be terrible. It absolutely takes time to develop a transportation system that works for adding so many new people to an area, especially if the point is to give lower income people a way to exist, a way to thrive. How would they do that without efficient public transportation? It would have an extremely negative effect because either they're going to have to figure out how to get a car. They're going to have to figure out a way to walk to where they need to be for work. They're going to have to figure out a way to walk to school because even the school bus system is out of whack in the area. There's going to have to be so much more. It's going to take so long to develop this. If it were to happen immediately, there would be absolutely no hope. It has an extremely negative impact unless the city already has an established and efficient public transportation system."

      "answer": "I mean, a lot of people are blind to environmental concerns to begin with, while it's very important to me, I think it would be the last thing on everybody else's mind for most people's minds. I'm not generalizing here. I think it would be the last thing on people's mind, unfortunately. I would say it has a negative effect. I can't see it having a positive effect of any kind. It's not like more people has ever led to the environment becoming better in human history. To environmentalists, it would certainly decrease support. To general people, I don't think it would have an effect at all. So depending on the person and their morals and how much they care about ethicality and environmental protection, it either is a very strong effect in the negative sense, or for unfortunately, probably the majority or at least a very fair amount of people, it's not going to be something that they think about compared to all the other problems."

I would have the same answer as I did to the last question because to me these two answers are tied in. Natural gases are something that we expend and that we are eventually going to run out of and that's always been the case and people don't think about it or consider it. So yes, I think same answer.

I'm just saying in regards to monopolies that corporations like Walmart, Sam's, things that have already monopolized the industry, they exist and they're already rooting out small businesses. So I don't see how people coming in and opening up new small locally owned businesses would be beneficial to themselves because they might easily be like purged out or like culled by the big corporations in every city or they would just potentially become competition to the already existing and already struggling locally owned businesses that are here. That's what I meant by monopolies."

      "answer": "I mean I feel like if current residents had less things to strive for or hope for or changes that they would need then perhaps it would be easier to accept upzoning. I think that's what I meant by that current residents interest is solving the current issues is necessary before we add more people to an area that's already dysfunctional or a city that's already dysfunctional. Things needs to be in a stable place before adding even more instability to it.

They have a right to survive, a right to electricity, a right to warmth, a right to the internet these days with the way things work. Everyone has their basic human rights. And of course, giving people a place to live is important. I would say that would have a positive effect on the idea of upzoning because it's the only big benefit that I could see and I'm sure a lot of people could see is it would give people who can't afford a place to live and make affording to live easier for people who are struggling. So it's a very strong effect. It's the one big positive that exists in all this."

I mean, I feel like as long as areas where, if already pre-established areas where lots of people who have been living here for a long time live remain untouched, that might lead to more support. But if negative changes happen to them, if things change in their lives and there's more chaos and change added to it, then that would be a negative effect. And it would be pretty strong either way.

So it's very hard already to deal with how many kids are in so many schools that already exist here. Adding even more to a certain area would totally overflow the school system. Like there would be no way to give attention to the kids who need it. There would be no way to have enough teachers. The classes are already so big, the sizes of the classes, I mean. And it would be immediate, especially if many people move in all at once. It would be a very negative effect. And I would say it's pretty strong. And this would be detrimental to both angry parents and kids who are not getting a proper education to begin with. It's such a poor school system already.

      "answer": "I don't really understand this question either. The main cause of single-family neighborhoods are just that they were already pre-established to begin with. In the past, homes used to be affordable, so it made sense to live the typical quote-unquote American dream and get your white picket fence little home with a single earner earning all the income for a family and being able to support a family of four on just one income. That's not possible anymore. So I would say that the cause of single-family neighborhoods is a time before everything was as ridiculously priced as it is now. It's not feasible anymore, but it used to be at least somewhat feasible in the past. Now it's basically impossible to be able to do that. So the cause of it is just it's pre-established. It already existed decades and decades ago. I would say that these influences just are. I don't think it's a positive or negative influence on cities. I think that it's nice to have areas like that. It's certainly incredibly expensive to live there, and rent is impossible to afford there, but I don't think that adding to those neighborhoods something that will decrease them in value is beneficial to anybody.

      "answer": "So, I think this significantly interrupts things. Of course, I'm thinking in terms of my own neighborhood, which I grew up in, and now after having returned from university, live in again, and it has always been single family neighborhoods in this whole area. I think there's an area with apartments further away, but it's the densest part of the city, and living there is kind of not the greatest. It's very stressful to try and find parking, and I know because I have friends that live there. Stores don't seem to be doing all that much better because so many more of them are open, so it kind of feels like the same thing, only it's just really hard to pick and choose where to go. I think that the biggest thing is it really would disrupt things. Change doesn't happen that rapidly. It happens very slowly, and those years of disruption would absolutely be very detrimental to the people living in this area, especially because there are lots of older people living here. So, I think that considering on a case-by-case basis, yes, there definitely are going to be some areas in which higher density housing would work, for instance, in bigger cities that already have higher density areas. But I think in even just generally urban, like not big cities, but like suburban areas, I do not think that it would work, and I would somewhat oppose it in those areas. Again, really dense areas like New York, Chicago, sure, I would support it, Atlanta. Cities where there genuinely is like overcapacity, like Phoenix maybe, but generally, I would not support it, no."

I worry about the kinds of people that might move in and worry that it might actually gentrify areas rather than make things more affordable. Of course I'm not very knowledgeable in what makes like a, there's a specific word for it, like a type of place where typically lower income people live, but even then I feel like making a specific part of the city like lower income can lead to a lot of problems like over-policing. I just don't see any real upsides to it. Even if things are made more affordable, I think that it's detrimental in many more areas that would definitely outtake that or overtake that."

      "answer": "I think it would definitely absolutely change neighborhoods, especially in neighborhoods that have single-family housing. It feels like having far more people in an area that is not ready for that, there would have to be such an insane change of infrastructure. Like, even if one apartment complex was built in the area that I live in, for instance, the schools nearby would not be able to handle that. They're already at capacity. The city would need to be able to afford to accommodate very many more people, for one, because I'm sure people would move to places where it's more affordable. That's what always happens. I feel like quality of life would definitely go down. Again, there are some areas where lots of older people live, and having droves of new people come in and disrupt the flow of things the way that they are is extremely detrimental to people who have lived the same way for very many years. And while I understand that adaptability is important, and people should be able to adapt for the greater good, I don't see this as the greater good. I think that it would take years and years of the city's infrastructure changing in order to accommodate this, and it would be completely detrimental in the meanwhile, in those years of transition. And even then, there's no guaranteeing the city would come out for the better because of it. Neighborhood in particular, yeah, it would be absolutely horrific for several years, maybe even a decade or so. I don't think it's worth it."

However establishing public transportation in cities that don't Sounds Absolutely impossible. I know that in my city for instance. We do not have good public transportation like It's Seemingly impossible to the bus has never come in time People who are trying to commute to make it to things like school and work. It's just not going to work out There are plenty of people who opt to just walk to work because it's so much more viable Than to wait for the bus which is always late and overcrowded and has problems and delays I Think it would make it so much worse Significantly worse and congestion is already not great in cities that don't have big apartment complexes or Upzoning basically like here traffic is a nightmare in a lot of places because it's a city on the border So those border like the word to get to the border on the freeway is always ridiculously congested I can't imagine how terrible it would be. It would become like Los Angeles without even having that many people and There's no way we could establish Public transportation any more functionally without years and years of money and effort.

It's up to them to figure out zoning, because the public does not have a responsibility to be doing that, especially if I think the public would be opposed to that here.

It would be totally up to local government to establish new things, not just the general public. I don't understand how it would be up to them."

      "answer": "Oh, I am significantly concerned about that. Already trying to get resources for like the general population of a city, like things like the natural gases that you would need, things for energy, electricity, power. I think that upzoning would absolutely be detrimental to the environment, yes. Now that I didn't even consider that, now that I'm thinking about it, that sounds horrific. I worry that there will be a lot more gasoline needed as well in these areas, because people are definitely going to need cars if they wanna get anywhere in time. The oil, the electricity, the water that would be needed even, just it doesn't sound like it would be beneficial to the planet or the people."

      "question": "What economic effects, both positive and negative, might result from changing zoning laws to allow more multi-family housing?",
      "answer": "This I'm less versed in. I don't understand what specific effects might happen, but I can make a couple of guesses maybe. I assume that more local businesses might be able to open up, but the thing is, I don't think that they would be able to compete with monopolies like Walmart or Sam's Club. Things like that. I still do think that local businesses would be wiped out just as easily as they have been. So I can't see very many positives aside from more money going to corporations, which is not a positive in my opinion. I suppose maybe it might benefit something economically for the city, like tax-wise perhaps or something. I can't imagine what. I'm thinking very hard about this and it's taking me a while to think. I'm trying to think of positives. I suppose maybe more professionals would be able to afford living in the city and that could be a net positive and maybe that would have an economic effect, but I really can't think of many positives. I suppose maybe, like was said, rent might become lower, but even with that, property values would go down it would seem. I don't think there are very many positives. There are certainly more net negatives."

      "question": "How do you think the interests of current residents versus future residents should be balanced when making zoning decisions?",
      "answer": "I think the interests of current residents are certainly the most important. We cannot predict the future. We are not time travelers. Sure, we have people who are professionals who can look at patterns and think about how it might go, but we don't know that for certain. We should worry about the people who are living here now and their futures, not potential people who might be here someday. Because once we start thinking in hypotheticals, people are going to start thinking in the way that benefits them, and powerful people, in other words, typically richer people, are going to have more of a say in the future of places. So I think that it would not benefit the people who are already living somewhere to think of future residents' best interests. I think that we should absolutely highlight and focus on the struggles of current residents and their interests and what they need, because adding a bunch of extra people to something that's not entirely functioning just is a recipe for disaster."

      "question_number": "10",
      "question": "What role do you think social equity and access to opportunity play in discussions about zoning and housing policy?",
      "answer": "Here it certainly gets more complicated in that yes, definitely people who can't afford to live somewhere need a place that's low income to live. I just don't think that that should be upzoning. I think that yes, low income housing should be established for sure. It would be very helpful. However, doing that in places that already have an established pattern, that already have an established presence, is detrimental to those places and to those people. It's not going to work. However, of course social equity plays a big amount and of course people have a right to have a place to live. People have a right to shelter, a right to food, a right to water, a right to the internet, a right to electricity. And upzoning areas that are already existing will not do that for them. I don't think so. It'll make everything harder for everybody. When it comes to social equity, I think it has everything to do with it and I think everybody deserves equal opportunity, which they won't get if we just start adding low income housing to areas that are already pre-existing. Areas need to be dictated for that or given for that. Again, very ideally by local government to see what would work the best. Perhaps in expanding cities, for instance, where they can build new schools or bigger schools or focus on an area that can be improved."

      "answer": "This question is a little confusing, so I need to take some time to talk through it and think about it. I think that larger shifts would be very detrimental to the population and the economy and just generally everything here. At least here in my city, I'm considering it from a bigger lens as best I can. I think that smaller changes would probably lead for more support or rather less negativity. I think that if things happened very fast, the negative changes would be very noticeable. Whereas if things happened in very little ways and slowly, perhaps the cities would be able to manage it better and the areas might be able to develop in time. And perhaps people won't realize things are getting worse if they do as quickly. Because people are able to turn a blind eye to things as long as they are doing okay a lot of the time. So it's like people might be blissfully ignorant if it's not affecting them. Whereas if there are these big things, then there will be a lot of people talking about it all at once very vocally and more people will be aware of it. So I think the less people that are aware, the less of an effect it will have generally."

      "answer": "Disruption to community has an extremely negative effect on support for upzoning. And I think it is very, very significant. I can't see anybody wanting things to change in that way. I understand that we do need areas for development, like choose specific areas for lower income housing, for new apartment buildings are affordable. But I can't see anybody wanting things to change like that. I can't see any of the neighborhoods nearby being able to function even remotely with that sort of change. I can't see any of the schools being able to handle it. All I can envision are angry parents with how the schools are going. I can consider angry older residents or distressed older residents with how much everything is changing. I can imagine shops dealing with new competition they haven't dealt with before, ones that are barely staying afloat compared to things like Walmart. I think that disruption is one of the biggest effects and probably the thing people would be the most against or feel the most strong about."

      "answer": "I think it's a significantly strong connection and something that we should think about. It definitely has a negative effect on how I would feel about upzoning because, for instance, my parents are in their late 60s to early 80s, like they are older. I can't see them being able to function that way. I can't see any of where the businesses they used to work at, I can't see that working. I understand that it's important for people to adapt, but I don't think people should have to adapt that significantly, especially in areas that are already established where people have owned homes for over 40, 50 years even. I don't think it's fair to shift things that significantly in established neighbourhoods, old local businesses that have somehow survived things like COVID and monopolies rising, corporations. It doesn't feel fair and it has a very strong effect on me and the way that I feel about it. I assume it would have a very strong effect on them and a very strong effect on their relatives, even relatives living elsewhere. Houses, even single family houses, are already crowded a lot of the time. It's a big family living in one house and the areas are crowded, the schools are crowded, the workplaces, it's already so hard to find a job. I can't see that many, I can't see it working. I can't see it being remotely beneficial for older people."

      "question": "What causes changes in Support for Upzoning? Are these influences strong or weak?",
      "answer": "think that I've been pretty clear on what causes changes in support. For instance, how fast it is, or how slow it is, or how quick, you know, just like how, how little or big the changes are, what, what's put in place to deal with it, how infrastructure changes, if we can work with transportation, that's like a limitless answer.

      "answer": "It's definitely a strong effect. And in areas where most people rent, it would be very beneficial. But in areas where most people own their houses, it has a negative effect. So it really just depends. It's a very strong effect in either a really good or a really bad way, depending on where this happens. In areas where most people rent, yes, upzoning would be great. It would make rent less for those people. And again, maybe it'll make property tax less in other areas, like family-owned houses, things like that. But it would also decrease the value of their property. So yeah, affordability kind of has everything to do with it. I think the biggest benefit would be being able to, for poorer people, for people of lower income, to afford a place to live. That's what's necessary. But we can't do it at the detriment of other people who are already established, because it would just lead to so many problems for everybody, including the low-income people moving in. It's unfortunate."

There's already an energy to it if that makes sense there's already something that people are used to and Change is not something very many people can adapt to very easily like yes We can adapt eventually, but is it something easy to adapt to absolutely not I? Think it would have a rather negative effect I can't see how adding an apartment complex for instance to an Area where there are pretty much just single-family houses Wouldn't not be totally out of place and have this sort of like new Congestion of traffic and new things opening up and everything changing I think the biggest issue is change and that does have a negative effect on things"

      "answer": "Oh, the effect of public transportation is absolutely immediate. It would be terrible. It absolutely takes time to develop a transportation system that works for adding so many new people to an area, especially if the point is to give lower income people a way to exist, a way to thrive. How would they do that without efficient public transportation? It would have an extremely negative effect because either they're going to have to figure out how to get a car. They're going to have to figure out a way to walk to where they need to be for work. They're going to have to figure out a way to walk to school because even the school bus system is out of whack in the area. There's going to have to be so much more. It's going to take so long to develop this. If it were to happen immediately, there would be absolutely no hope.

      "answer": "I mean, a lot of people are blind to environmental concerns to begin with, while it's very important to me, I think it would be the last thing on everybody else's mind for most people's minds. I'm not generalizing here. I think it would be the last thing on people's mind, unfortunately. I would say it has a negative effect. I can't see it having a positive effect of any kind. It's not like more people has ever led to the environment becoming better in human history. To environmentalists, it would certainly decrease support. To general people, I don't think it would have an effect at all. So depending on the person and their morals and how much they care about ethicality and environmental protection, it either is a very strong effect in the negative sense, or for unfortunately, probably the majority or at least a very fair amount of people, it's not going to be something that they think about compared to all the other problems."

I would have the same answer as I did to the last question because to me these two answers are tied in. Natural gases are something that we expend and that we are eventually going to run out of and that's always been the case and people don't think about it or consider it. So yes, I think same answer.

I'm just saying in regards to monopolies that corporations like Walmart, Sam's, things that have already monopolized the industry, they exist and they're already rooting out small businesses. So I don't see how people coming in and opening up new small locally owned businesses would be beneficial to themselves because they might easily be like purged out or like culled by the big corporations in every city or they would just potentially become competition to the already existing and already struggling locally owned businesses that are here. That's what I meant by monopolies."

      "answer": "I mean I feel like if current residents had less things to strive for or hope for or changes that they would need then perhaps it would be easier to accept upzoning. I think that's what I meant by that current residents interest is solving the current issues is necessary before we add more people to an area that's already dysfunctional or a city that's already dysfunctional. Things needs to be in a stable place before adding even more instability to it.

They have a right to survive, a right to electricity, a right to warmth, a right to the internet these days with the way things work. Everyone has their basic human rights. And of course, giving people a place to live is important. I would say that would have a positive effect on the idea of upzoning because it's the only big benefit that I could see and I'm sure a lot of people could see is it would give people who can't afford a place to live and make affording to live easier for people who are struggling. So it's a very strong effect. It's the one big positive that exists in all this."

I mean, I feel like as long as areas where, if already pre-established areas where lots of people who have been living here for a long time live remain untouched, that might lead to more support. But if negative changes happen to them, if things change in their lives and there's more chaos and change added to it, then that would be a negative effect. And it would be pretty strong either way.

So it's very hard already to deal with how many kids are in so many schools that already exist here. Adding even more to a certain area would totally overflow the school system. Like there would be no way to give attention to the kids who need it. There would be no way to have enough teachers. The classes are already so big, the sizes of the classes, I mean. And it would be immediate, especially if many people move in all at once. It would be a very negative effect. And I would say it's pretty strong. And this would be detrimental to both angry parents and kids who are not getting a proper education to begin with. It's such a poor school system already. Adding even more weights to something that's breaking is not going to be efficient or effective or good."

      "answer": "I don't really understand this question either. The main cause of single-family neighborhoods are just that they were already pre-established to begin with. In the past, homes used to be affordable, so it made sense to live the typical quote-unquote American dream and get your white picket fence little home with a single earner earning all the income for a family and being able to support a family of four on just one income. That's not possible anymore. So I would say that the cause of single-family neighborhoods is a time before everything was as ridiculously priced as it is now. It's not feasible anymore, but it used to be at least somewhat feasible in the past. Now it's basically impossible to be able to do that. So the cause of it is just it's pre-established. It already existed decades and decades ago. I would say that these influences just are. I don't think it's a positive or negative influence on cities. I think that it's nice to have areas like that. It's certainly incredibly expensive to live there, and rent is impossible to afford there, but I don't think that adding to those neighborhoods something that will decrease them in value is beneficial to anybody.

      "answer": "So, I think this significantly interrupts things. Of course, I'm thinking in terms of my own neighborhood, which I grew up in, and now after having returned from university, live in again, and it has always been single family neighborhoods in this whole area. I think there's an area with apartments further away, but it's the densest part of the city, and living there is kind of not the greatest. It's very stressful to try and find parking, and I know because I have friends that live there. Stores don't seem to be doing all that much better because so many more of them are open, so it kind of feels like the same thing, only it's just really hard to pick and choose where to go. I think that the biggest thing is it really would disrupt things. Change doesn't happen that rapidly. It happens very slowly, and those years of disruption would absolutely be very detrimental to the people living in this area, especially because there are lots of older people living here. So, I think that considering on a case-by-case basis, yes, there definitely are going to be some areas in which higher density housing would work, for instance, in bigger cities that already have higher density areas. But I think in even just generally urban, like not big cities, but like suburban areas, I do not think that it would work, and I would somewhat oppose it in those areas. Again, really dense areas like New York, Chicago, sure, I would support it, Atlanta. Cities where there genuinely is like overcapacity, like Phoenix maybe, but generally, I would not support it, no."

It kind of feels like, even though I know it's going to be more affordable, it somewhat feels like it's going to completely change the area, and it'll take a very long time for it to get back to normal. I think that those are the negative impacts. Positive, yes, rent would go down for sure. However, there are lots of places in which people don't rent their houses or apartments. So I think it would be really detrimental to property value, for instance, if people who own their houses, all of a sudden, they're going to be worth a lot less, it seems.

I worry about the kinds of people that might move in and worry that it might actually gentrify areas rather than make things more affordable. Of course I'm not very knowledgeable in what makes like a, there's a specific word for it, like a type of place where typically lower income people live, but even then I feel like making a specific part of the city like lower income can lead to a lot of problems like over-policing. I just don't see any real upsides to it. Even if things are made more affordable, I think that it's detrimental in many more areas that would definitely outtake that or overtake that."

It feels like having far more people in an area that is not ready for that, there would have to be such an insane change of infrastructure. Like, even if one apartment complex was built in the area that I live in, for instance, the schools nearby would not be able to handle that. They're already at capacity. The city would need to be able to afford to accommodate very many more people, for one, because I'm sure people would move to places where it's more affordable. That's what always happens. I feel like quality of life would definitely go down. Again, there are some areas where lots of older people live, and having droves of new people come in and disrupt the flow of things the way that they are is extremely detrimental to people who have lived the same way for very many years. And while I understand that adaptability is important, and people should be able to adapt for the greater good, I don't see this as the greater good. I think that it would take years and years of the city's infrastructure changing in order to accommodate this, and it would be completely detrimental in the meanwhile, in those years of transition. And even then, there's no guaranteeing the city would come out for the better because of it. Neighborhood in particular, yeah, it would be absolutely horrific for several years, maybe even a decade or so. I don't think it's worth it."

It's just not going to work out There are plenty of people who opt to just walk to work because it's so much more viable Than to wait for the bus which is always late and overcrowded and has problems and delays I Think it would make it so much worse Significantly worse and congestion is already not great in cities that don't have big apartment complexes or Upzoning basically like here traffic is a nightmare in a lot of places because it's a city on the border So those border like the word to get to the border on the freeway is always ridiculously congested I can't imagine how terrible it would be. It would become like Los Angeles without even having that many people and There's no way we could establish Public transportation any more functionally without years and years of money and effort. I don't see how this would be a beneficial thing Unless it's in cities. They've already established some sort of public transportation"

      "answer": "I mean, I think it would be entirely up to them to make up for absolutely everything. The public would not have to make up for this if they're doing something like that. It is up to them to fix public transportation. It is up to them to figure out how to manage schools. It's up to them to figure out zoning, because the public does not have a responsibility to be doing that, especially if I think the public would be opposed to that here. Yeah, we have areas with apartments for sure, but those areas tend to be older. They have things that are already established. It would be totally up to local government to establish new things, not just the general public. I don't understand how it would be up to them."

      "answer": "Oh, I am significantly concerned about that. Already trying to get resources for like the general population of a city, like things like the natural gases that you would need, things for energy, electricity, power. I think that upzoning would absolutely be detrimental to the environment, yes. Now that I didn't even consider that, now that I'm thinking about it, that sounds horrific. I worry that there will be a lot more gasoline needed as well in these areas, because people are definitely going to need cars if they wanna get anywhere in time. The oil, the electricity, the water that would be needed even, just it doesn't sound like it would be beneficial to the planet or the people."

      "question": "What economic effects, both positive and negative, might result from changing zoning laws to allow more multi-family housing?",
      "answer": "This I'm less versed in. I don't understand what specific effects might happen, but I can make a couple of guesses maybe. I assume that more local businesses might be able to open up, but the thing is, I don't think that they would be able to compete with monopolies like Walmart or Sam's Club. Things like that. I still do think that local businesses would be wiped out just as easily as they have been. So I can't see very many positives aside from more money going to corporations, which is not a positive in my opinion. I suppose maybe it might benefit something economically for the city, like tax-wise perhaps or something. I can't imagine what. I'm thinking very hard about this and it's taking me a while to think. I'm trying to think of positives. I suppose maybe more professionals would be able to afford living in the city and that could be a net positive and maybe that would have an economic effect, but I really can't think of many positives. I suppose maybe, like was said, rent might become lower, but even with that, property values would go down it would seem. I don't think there are very many positives. There are certainly more net negatives."

      "question": "How do you think the interests of current residents versus future residents should be balanced when making zoning decisions?",
      "answer": "I think the interests of current residents are certainly the most important. We cannot predict the future. We are not time travelers. Sure, we have people who are professionals who can look at patterns and think about how it might go, but we don't know that for certain. We should worry about the people who are living here now and their futures, not potential people who might be here someday. Because once we start thinking in hypotheticals, people are going to start thinking in the way that benefits them, and powerful people, in other words, typically richer people, are going to have more of a say in the future of places. So I think that it would not benefit the people who are already living somewhere to think of future residents' best interests. I think that we should absolutely highlight and focus on the struggles of current residents and their interests and what they need, because adding a bunch of extra people to something that's not entirely functioning just is a recipe for disaster."

      "question_number": "10",
      "question": "What role do you think social equity and access to opportunity play in discussions about zoning and housing policy?",
      "answer": "Here it certainly gets more complicated in that yes, definitely people who can't afford to live somewhere need a place that's low income to live. I just don't think that that should be upzoning. I think that yes, low income housing should be established for sure. It would be very helpful. However, doing that in places that already have an established pattern, that already have an established presence, is detrimental to those places and to those people. It's not going to work. However, of course social equity plays a big amount and of course people have a right to have a place to live. People have a right to shelter, a right to food, a right to water, a right to the internet, a right to electricity. And upzoning areas that are already existing will not do that for them. I don't think so. It'll make everything harder for everybody. When it comes to social equity, I think it has everything to do with it and I think everybody deserves equal opportunity, which they won't get if we just start adding low income housing to areas that are already pre-existing. Areas need to be dictated for that or given for that. Again, very ideally by local government to see what would work the best. Perhaps in expanding cities, for instance, where they can build new schools or bigger schools or focus on an area that can be improved."

      "answer": "This question is a little confusing, so I need to take some time to talk through it and think about it. I think that larger shifts would be very detrimental to the population and the economy and just generally everything here. At least here in my city, I'm considering it from a bigger lens as best I can. I think that smaller changes would probably lead for more support or rather less negativity. I think that if things happened very fast, the negative changes would be very noticeable. Whereas if things happened in very little ways and slowly, perhaps the cities would be able to manage it better and the areas might be able to develop in time. And perhaps people won't realize things are getting worse if they do as quickly. Because people are able to turn a blind eye to things as long as they are doing okay a lot of the time. So it's like people might be blissfully ignorant if it's not affecting them. Whereas if there are these big things, then there will be a lot of people talking about it all at once very vocally and more people will be aware of it. So I think the less people that are aware, the less of an effect it will have generally."

      "answer": "Disruption to community has an extremely negative effect on support for upzoning. And I think it is very, very significant. I can't see anybody wanting things to change in that way. I understand that we do need areas for development, like choose specific areas for lower income housing, for new apartment buildings are affordable. But I can't see anybody wanting things to change like that. I can't see any of the neighborhoods nearby being able to function even remotely with that sort of change. I can't see any of the schools being able to handle it. All I can envision are angry parents with how the schools are going. I can consider angry older residents or distressed older residents with how much everything is changing. I can imagine shops dealing with new competition they haven't dealt with before, ones that are barely staying afloat compared to things like Walmart. I think that disruption is one of the biggest effects and probably the thing people would be the most against or feel the most strong about."

      "answer": "I think it's a significantly strong connection and something that we should think about. It definitely has a negative effect on how I would feel about upzoning because, for instance, my parents are in their late 60s to early 80s, like they are older. I can't see them being able to function that way. I can't see any of where the businesses they used to work at, I can't see that working. I understand that it's important for people to adapt, but I don't think people should have to adapt that significantly, especially in areas that are already established where people have owned homes for over 40, 50 years even. I don't think it's fair to shift things that significantly in established neighbourhoods, old local businesses that have somehow survived things like COVID and monopolies rising, corporations. It doesn't feel fair and it has a very strong effect on me and the way that I feel about it. I assume it would have a very strong effect on them and a very strong effect on their relatives, even relatives living elsewhere. Houses, even single family houses, are already crowded a lot of the time. It's a big family living in one house and the areas are crowded, the schools are crowded, the workplaces, it's already so hard to find a job. I can't see that many, I can't see it working. I can't see it being remotely beneficial for older people."

      "answer": "think that I've been pretty clear on what causes changes in support. For instance, how fast it is, or how slow it is, or how quick, you know, just like how, how little or big the changes are, what, what's put in place to deal with it, how infrastructure changes, if we can work with transportation, that's like a limitless answer. And these influences are both strong and weak, depending, I think that this is all the questions that have already been answered before, basically, I can't like list them all over again."

      "answer": "It's definitely a strong effect. And in areas where most people rent, it would be very beneficial. But in areas where most people own their houses, it has a negative effect. So it really just depends. It's a very strong effect in either a really good or a really bad way, depending on where this happens. In areas where most people rent, yes, upzoning would be great. It would make rent less for those people. And again, maybe it'll make property tax less in other areas, like family-owned houses, things like that. But it would also decrease the value of their property. So yeah, affordability kind of has everything to do with it. I think the biggest benefit would be being able to, for poorer people, for people of lower income, to afford a place to live. That's what's necessary. But we can't do it at the detriment of other people who are already established, because it would just lead to so many problems for everybody, including the low-income people moving in.

There's already an energy to it if that makes sense there's already something that people are used to and Change is not something very many people can adapt to very easily like yes We can adapt eventually, but is it something easy to adapt to absolutely not I? Think it would have a rather negative effect I can't see how adding an apartment complex for instance to an Area where there are pretty much just single-family houses Wouldn't not be totally out of place and have this sort of like new Congestion of traffic and new things opening up and everything changing I think the biggest issue is change and that does have a negative effect on things"

      "answer": "Oh, the effect of public transportation is absolutely immediate. It would be terrible. It absolutely takes time to develop a transportation system that works for adding so many new people to an area, especially if the point is to give lower income people a way to exist, a way to thrive. How would they do that without efficient public transportation? It would have an extremely negative effect because either they're going to have to figure out how to get a car. They're going to have to figure out a way to walk to where they need to be for work. They're going to have to figure out a way to walk to school because even the school bus system is out of whack in the area. There's going to have to be so much more. It's going to take so long to develop this. If it were to happen immediately, there would be absolutely no hope.

      "answer": "I mean, a lot of people are blind to environmental concerns to begin with, while it's very important to me, I think it would be the last thing on everybody else's mind for most people's minds. I'm not generalizing here. I think it would be the last thing on people's mind, unfortunately. I would say it has a negative effect. I can't see it having a positive effect of any kind. It's not like more people has ever led to the environment becoming better in human history. To environmentalists, it would certainly decrease support. To general people, I don't think it would have an effect at all. So depending on the person and their morals and how much they care about ethicality and environmental protection, it either is a very strong effect in the negative sense, or for unfortunately, probably the majority or at least a very fair amount of people, it's not going to be something that they think about compared to all the other problems."

I would have the same answer as I did to the last question because to me these two answers are tied in. Natural gases are something that we expend and that we are eventually going to run out of and that's always been the case and people don't think about it or consider it. So yes, I think same answer.

I'm just saying in regards to monopolies that corporations like Walmart, Sam's, things that have already monopolized the industry, they exist and they're already rooting out small businesses. So I don't see how people coming in and opening up new small locally owned businesses would be beneficial to themselves because they might easily be like purged out or like culled by the big corporations in every city or they would just potentially become competition to the already existing and already struggling locally owned businesses that are here. That's what I meant by monopolies."

      "answer": "I mean I feel like if current residents had less things to strive for or hope for or changes that they would need then perhaps it would be easier to accept upzoning. I think that's what I meant by that current residents interest is solving the current issues is necessary before we add more people to an area that's already dysfunctional or a city that's already dysfunctional. Things needs to be in a stable place before adding even more instability to it. So I would say it has a pretty strong effect because content people are more likely to accept change than people who are already having a hard time or are already angry about something."

They have a right to survive, a right to electricity, a right to warmth, a right to the internet these days with the way things work. Everyone has their basic human rights. And of course, giving people a place to live is important. I would say that would have a positive effect on the idea of upzoning because it's the only big benefit that I could see and I'm sure a lot of people could see is it would give people who can't afford a place to live and make affording to live easier for people who are struggling. So it's a very strong effect. It's the one big positive that exists in all this."

I mean, I feel like as long as areas where, if already pre-established areas where lots of people who have been living here for a long time live remain untouched, that might lead to more support. But if negative changes happen to them, if things change in their lives and there's more chaos and change added to it, then that would be a negative effect. And it would be pretty strong either way.

So it's very hard already to deal with how many kids are in so many schools that already exist here. Adding even more to a certain area would totally overflow the school system. Like there would be no way to give attention to the kids who need it. There would be no way to have enough teachers. The classes are already so big, the sizes of the classes, I mean. And it would be immediate, especially if many people move in all at once. It would be a very negative effect. And I would say it's pretty strong. And this would be detrimental to both angry parents and kids who are not getting a proper education to begin with. It's such a poor school system already.

      "answer": "I don't really understand this question either. The main cause of single-family neighborhoods are just that they were already pre-established to begin with. In the past, homes used to be affordable, so it made sense to live the typical quote-unquote American dream and get your white picket fence little home with a single earner earning all the income for a family and being able to support a family of four on just one income. That's not possible anymore. So I would say that the cause of single-family neighborhoods is a time before everything was as ridiculously priced as it is now. It's not feasible anymore, but it used to be at least somewhat feasible in the past. Now it's basically impossible to be able to do that. So the cause of it is just it's pre-established. It already existed decades and decades ago. I would say that these influences just are. I don't think it's a positive or negative influence on cities. I think that it's nice to have areas like that. It's certainly incredibly expensive to live there, and rent is impossible to afford there, but I don't think that adding to those neighborhoods something that will decrease them in value is beneficial to anybody.

      "answer": "So, I think this significantly interrupts things. Of course, I'm thinking in terms of my own neighborhood, which I grew up in, and now after having returned from university, live in again, and it has always been single family neighborhoods in this whole area. I think there's an area with apartments further away, but it's the densest part of the city, and living there is kind of not the greatest. It's very stressful to try and find parking, and I know because I have friends that live there. Stores don't seem to be doing all that much better because so many more of them are open, so it kind of feels like the same thing, only it's just really hard to pick and choose where to go. I think that the biggest thing is it really would disrupt things. Change doesn't happen that rapidly. It happens very slowly, and those years of disruption would absolutely be very detrimental to the people living in this area, especially because there are lots of older people living here. So, I think that considering on a case-by-case basis, yes, there definitely are going to be some areas in which higher density housing would work, for instance, in bigger cities that already have higher density areas. But I think in even just generally urban, like not big cities, but like suburban areas, I do not think that it would work, and I would somewhat oppose it in those areas. Again, really dense areas like New York, Chicago, sure, I would support it, Atlanta. Cities where there genuinely is like overcapacity, like Phoenix maybe, but generally, I would not support it, no."

I think that the already existing businesses, which are doing just fine, would have a hard time competing with all the new ones that came in, maybe more modern ones. It kind of feels like, even though I know it's going to be more affordable, it somewhat feels like it's going to completely change the area, and it'll take a very long time for it to get back to normal. I think that those are the negative impacts. Positive, yes, rent would go down for sure. However, there are lots of places in which people don't rent their houses or apartments. So I think it would be really detrimental to property value, for instance, if people who own their houses, all of a sudden, they're going to be worth a lot less, it seems.

I worry about the kinds of people that might move in and worry that it might actually gentrify areas rather than make things more affordable. Of course I'm not very knowledgeable in what makes like a, there's a specific word for it, like a type of place where typically lower income people live, but even then I feel like making a specific part of the city like lower income can lead to a lot of problems like over-policing. I just don't see any real upsides to it. Even if things are made more affordable, I think that it's detrimental in many more areas that would definitely outtake that or overtake that."

It feels like having far more people in an area that is not ready for that, there would have to be such an insane change of infrastructure. Like, even if one apartment complex was built in the area that I live in, for instance, the schools nearby would not be able to handle that. They're already at capacity. The city would need to be able to afford to accommodate very many more people, for one, because I'm sure people would move to places where it's more affordable. That's what always happens. I feel like quality of life would definitely go down. Again, there are some areas where lots of older people live, and having droves of new people come in and disrupt the flow of things the way that they are is extremely detrimental to people who have lived the same way for very many years. And while I understand that adaptability is important, and people should be able to adapt for the greater good, I don't see this as the greater good. I think that it would take years and years of the city's infrastructure changing in order to accommodate this, and it would be completely detrimental in the meanwhile, in those years of transition. And even then, there's no guaranteeing the city would come out for the better because of it. Neighborhood in particular, yeah, it would be absolutely horrific for several years, maybe even a decade or so. I don't think it's worth it."

      "answer": "There are some cities that have good transportation systems, but again, these are areas that already have Very many apartments areas like New York or Chicago with you know subways or trains Metros for instance things like that like there are plenty of there's public transportation in cities that already need it. However establishing public transportation in cities that don't Sounds Absolutely impossible. I know that in my city for instance. We do not have good public transportation like It's Seemingly impossible to the bus has never come in time People who are trying to commute to make it to things like school and work. It's just not going to work out There are plenty of people who opt to just walk to work because it's so much more viable Than to wait for the bus which is always late and overcrowded and has problems and delays I Think it would make it so much worse Significantly worse and congestion is already not great in cities that don't have big apartment complexes or Upzoning basically like here traffic is a nightmare in a lot of places because it's a city on the border So those border like the word to get to the border on the freeway is always ridiculously congested I can't imagine how terrible it would be. It would become like Los Angeles without even having that many people and There's no way we could establish Public transportation any more functionally without years and years of money and effort. I don't see how this would be a beneficial thing Unless it's in cities. They've already established some sort of public transportation"

      "answer": "I mean, I think it would be entirely up to them to make up for absolutely everything. The public would not have to make up for this if they're doing something like that. It is up to them to fix public transportation. It is up to them to figure out how to manage schools. It's up to them to figure out zoning, because the public does not have a responsibility to be doing that, especially if I think the public would be opposed to that here. Yeah, we have areas with apartments for sure, but those areas tend to be older. They have things that are already established. It would be totally up to local government to establish new things, not just the general public. I don't understand how it would be up to them."

      "answer": "Oh, I am significantly concerned about that. Already trying to get resources for like the general population of a city, like things like the natural gases that you would need, things for energy, electricity, power. I think that upzoning would absolutely be detrimental to the environment, yes. Now that I didn't even consider that, now that I'm thinking about it, that sounds horrific. I worry that there will be a lot more gasoline needed as well in these areas, because people are definitely going to need cars if they wanna get anywhere in time. The oil, the electricity, the water that would be needed even, just it doesn't sound like it would be beneficial to the planet or the people."

      "question": "What economic effects, both positive and negative, might result from changing zoning laws to allow more multi-family housing?",
      "answer": "This I'm less versed in. I don't understand what specific effects might happen, but I can make a couple of guesses maybe. I assume that more local businesses might be able to open up, but the thing is, I don't think that they would be able to compete with monopolies like Walmart or Sam's Club. Things like that. I still do think that local businesses would be wiped out just as easily as they have been. So I can't see very many positives aside from more money going to corporations, which is not a positive in my opinion. I suppose maybe it might benefit something economically for the city, like tax-wise perhaps or something. I can't imagine what. I'm thinking very hard about this and it's taking me a while to think. I'm trying to think of positives. I suppose maybe more professionals would be able to afford living in the city and that could be a net positive and maybe that would have an economic effect, but I really can't think of many positives. I suppose maybe, like was said, rent might become lower, but even with that, property values would go down it would seem. I don't think there are very many positives. There are certainly more net negatives."

      "question_number": "9",
      "question": "How do you think the interests of current residents versus future residents should be balanced when making zoning decisions?",
      "answer": "I think the interests of current residents are certainly the most important. We cannot predict the future. We are not time travelers. Sure, we have people who are professionals who can look at patterns and think about how it might go, but we don't know that for certain. We should worry about the people who are living here now and their futures, not potential people who might be here someday. Because once we start thinking in hypotheticals, people are going to start thinking in the way that benefits them, and powerful people, in other words, typically richer people, are going to have more of a say in the future of places. So I think that it would not benefit the people who are already living somewhere to think of future residents' best interests. I think that we should absolutely highlight and focus on the struggles of current residents and their interests and what they need, because adding a bunch of extra people to something that's not entirely functioning just is a recipe for disaster."

      "question_number": "10",
      "question": "What role do you think social equity and access to opportunity play in discussions about zoning and housing policy?",
      "answer": "Here it certainly gets more complicated in that yes, definitely people who can't afford to live somewhere need a place that's low income to live. I just don't think that that should be upzoning. I think that yes, low income housing should be established for sure. It would be very helpful. However, doing that in places that already have an established pattern, that already have an established presence, is detrimental to those places and to those people. It's not going to work. However, of course social equity plays a big amount and of course people have a right to have a place to live. People have a right to shelter, a right to food, a right to water, a right to the internet, a right to electricity. And upzoning areas that are already existing will not do that for them. I don't think so. It'll make everything harder for everybody. When it comes to social equity, I think it has everything to do with it and I think everybody deserves equal opportunity, which they won't get if we just start adding low income housing to areas that are already pre-existing. Areas need to be dictated for that or given for that. Again, very ideally by local government to see what would work the best. Perhaps in expanding cities, for instance, where they can build new schools or bigger schools or focus on an area that can be improved."

      "question": "Would small changes in Higher density housing lead to noticeable changes in Support for Upzoning, or would it take larger shifts? Does it have a positive effect (increasing it) or a negative effect (decreasing it)? How strong is this effect?",
      "answer": "This question is a little confusing, so I need to take some time to talk through it and think about it. I think that larger shifts would be very detrimental to the population and the economy and just generally everything here. At least here in my city, I'm considering it from a bigger lens as best I can. I think that smaller changes would probably lead for more support or rather less negativity. I think that if things happened very fast, the negative changes would be very noticeable. Whereas if things happened in very little ways and slowly, perhaps the cities would be able to manage it better and the areas might be able to develop in time. And perhaps people won't realize things are getting worse if they do as quickly. Because people are able to turn a blind eye to things as long as they are doing okay a lot of the time. So it's like people might be blissfully ignorant if it's not affecting them. Whereas if there are these big things, then there will be a lot of people talking about it all at once very vocally and more people will be aware of it. So I think the less people that are aware, the less of an effect it will have generally."

      "answer": "Disruption to community has an extremely negative effect on support for upzoning. And I think it is very, very significant. I can't see anybody wanting things to change in that way. I understand that we do need areas for development, like choose specific areas for lower income housing, for new apartment buildings are affordable. But I can't see anybody wanting things to change like that. I can't see any of the neighborhoods nearby being able to function even remotely with that sort of change. I can't see any of the schools being able to handle it. All I can envision are angry parents with how the schools are going. I can consider angry older residents or distressed older residents with how much everything is changing. I can imagine shops dealing with new competition they haven't dealt with before, ones that are barely staying afloat compared to things like Walmart. I think that disruption is one of the biggest effects and probably the thing people would be the most against or feel the most strong about."

      "answer": "I think it's a significantly strong connection and something that we should think about. It definitely has a negative effect on how I would feel about upzoning because, for instance, my parents are in their late 60s to early 80s, like they are older. I can't see them being able to function that way. I can't see any of where the businesses they used to work at, I can't see that working. I understand that it's important for people to adapt, but I don't think people should have to adapt that significantly, especially in areas that are already established where people have owned homes for over 40, 50 years even. I don't think it's fair to shift things that significantly in established neighbourhoods, old local businesses that have somehow survived things like COVID and monopolies rising, corporations. It doesn't feel fair and it has a very strong effect on me and the way that I feel about it. I assume it would have a very strong effect on them and a very strong effect on their relatives, even relatives living elsewhere. Houses, even single family houses, are already crowded a lot of the time. It's a big family living in one house and the areas are crowded, the schools are crowded, the workplaces, it's already so hard to find a job. I can't see that many, I can't see it working. I can't see it being remotely beneficial for older people."

      "question": "What causes changes in Support for Upzoning? Are these influences strong or weak?",
      "answer": "think that I've been pretty clear on what causes changes in support. For instance, how fast it is, or how slow it is, or how quick, you know, just like how, how little or big the changes are, what, what's put in place to deal with it, how infrastructure changes, if we can work with transportation, that's like a limitless answer. And these influences are both strong and weak, depending, I think that this is all the questions that have already been answered before, basically, I can't like list them all over again."

      "answer": "It's definitely a strong effect. And in areas where most people rent, it would be very beneficial. But in areas where most people own their houses, it has a negative effect. So it really just depends. It's a very strong effect in either a really good or a really bad way, depending on where this happens. In areas where most people rent, yes, upzoning would be great. It would make rent less for those people. And again, maybe it'll make property tax less in other areas, like family-owned houses, things like that. But it would also decrease the value of their property. So yeah, affordability kind of has everything to do with it. I think the biggest benefit would be being able to, for poorer people, for people of lower income, to afford a place to live. That's what's necessary. But we can't do it at the detriment of other people who are already established, because it would just lead to so many problems for everybody, including the low-income people moving in. It's unfortunate."

There's already an energy to it if that makes sense there's already something that people are used to and Change is not something very many people can adapt to very easily like yes We can adapt eventually, but is it something easy to adapt to absolutely not I? Think it would have a rather negative effect I can't see how adding an apartment complex for instance to an Area where there are pretty much just single-family houses Wouldn't not be totally out of place and have this sort of like new Congestion of traffic and new things opening up and everything changing I think the biggest issue is change and that does have a negative effect on things"

      "answer": "Oh, the effect of public transportation is absolutely immediate. It would be terrible. It absolutely takes time to develop a transportation system that works for adding so many new people to an area, especially if the point is to give lower income people a way to exist, a way to thrive. How would they do that without efficient public transportation? It would have an extremely negative effect because either they're going to have to figure out how to get a car. They're going to have to figure out a way to walk to where they need to be for work. They're going to have to figure out a way to walk to school because even the school bus system is out of whack in the area. There's going to have to be so much more. It's going to take so long to develop this. If it were to happen immediately, there would be absolutely no hope.

      "answer": "I mean, a lot of people are blind to environmental concerns to begin with, while it's very important to me, I think it would be the last thing on everybody else's mind for most people's minds. I'm not generalizing here. I think it would be the last thing on people's mind, unfortunately. I would say it has a negative effect. I can't see it having a positive effect of any kind. It's not like more people has ever led to the environment becoming better in human history. To environmentalists, it would certainly decrease support. To general people, I don't think it would have an effect at all. So depending on the person and their morals and how much they care about ethicality and environmental protection, it either is a very strong effect in the negative sense, or for unfortunately, probably the majority or at least a very fair amount of people, it's not going to be something that they think about compared to all the other problems."

I would have the same answer as I did to the last question because to me these two answers are tied in. Natural gases are something that we expend and that we are eventually going to run out of and that's always been the case and people don't think about it or consider it. So yes, I think same answer.

I'm just saying in regards to monopolies that corporations like Walmart, Sam's, things that have already monopolized the industry, they exist and they're already rooting out small businesses. So I don't see how people coming in and opening up new small locally owned businesses would be beneficial to themselves because they might easily be like purged out or like culled by the big corporations in every city or they would just potentially become competition to the already existing and already struggling locally owned businesses that are here. That's what I meant by monopolies."

      "answer": "I mean I feel like if current residents had less things to strive for or hope for or changes that they would need then perhaps it would be easier to accept upzoning. I think that's what I meant by that current residents interest is solving the current issues is necessary before we add more people to an area that's already dysfunctional or a city that's already dysfunctional. Things needs to be in a stable place before adding even more instability to it.

They have a right to survive, a right to electricity, a right to warmth, a right to the internet these days with the way things work. Everyone has their basic human rights. And of course, giving people a place to live is important. I would say that would have a positive effect on the idea of upzoning because it's the only big benefit that I could see and I'm sure a lot of people could see is it would give people who can't afford a place to live and make affording to live easier for people who are struggling. So it's a very strong effect. It's the one big positive that exists in all this."

I mean, I feel like as long as areas where, if already pre-established areas where lots of people who have been living here for a long time live remain untouched, that might lead to more support. But if negative changes happen to them, if things change in their lives and there's more chaos and change added to it, then that would be a negative effect. And it would be pretty strong either way.

So it's very hard already to deal with how many kids are in so many schools that already exist here. Adding even more to a certain area would totally overflow the school system. Like there would be no way to give attention to the kids who need it. There would be no way to have enough teachers. The classes are already so big, the sizes of the classes, I mean. And it would be immediate, especially if many people move in all at once. It would be a very negative effect. And I would say it's pretty strong. And this would be detrimental to both angry parents and kids who are not getting a proper education to begin with. It's such a poor school system already.

      "answer": "I don't really understand this question either. The main cause of single-family neighborhoods are just that they were already pre-established to begin with. In the past, homes used to be affordable, so it made sense to live the typical quote-unquote American dream and get your white picket fence little home with a single earner earning all the income for a family and being able to support a family of four on just one income. That's not possible anymore. So I would say that the cause of single-family neighborhoods is a time before everything was as ridiculously priced as it is now. It's not feasible anymore, but it used to be at least somewhat feasible in the past. Now it's basically impossible to be able to do that. So the cause of it is just it's pre-established. It already existed decades and decades ago. I would say that these influences just are. I don't think it's a positive or negative influence on cities. I think that it's nice to have areas like that. It's certainly incredibly expensive to live there, and rent is impossible to afford there, but I don't think that adding to those neighborhoods something that will decrease them in value is beneficial to anybody.

      "answer": "So, I think this significantly interrupts things. Of course, I'm thinking in terms of my own neighborhood, which I grew up in, and now after having returned from university, live in again, and it has always been single family neighborhoods in this whole area. I think there's an area with apartments further away, but it's the densest part of the city, and living there is kind of not the greatest. It's very stressful to try and find parking, and I know because I have friends that live there. Stores don't seem to be doing all that much better because so many more of them are open, so it kind of feels like the same thing, only it's just really hard to pick and choose where to go. I think that the biggest thing is it really would disrupt things. Change doesn't happen that rapidly. It happens very slowly, and those years of disruption would absolutely be very detrimental to the people living in this area, especially because there are lots of older people living here. So, I think that considering on a case-by-case basis, yes, there definitely are going to be some areas in which higher density housing would work, for instance, in bigger cities that already have higher density areas. But I think in even just generally urban, like not big cities, but like suburban areas, I do not think that it would work, and I would somewhat oppose it in those areas. Again, really dense areas like New York, Chicago, sure, I would support it, Atlanta. Cities where there genuinely is like overcapacity, like Phoenix maybe, but generally, I would not support it, no."

It kind of feels like, even though I know it's going to be more affordable, it somewhat feels like it's going to completely change the area, and it'll take a very long time for it to get back to normal. I think that those are the negative impacts. Positive, yes, rent would go down for sure. However, there are lots of places in which people don't rent their houses or apartments. So I think it would be really detrimental to property value, for instance, if people who own their houses, all of a sudden, they're going to be worth a lot less, it seems.

I worry about the kinds of people that might move in and worry that it might actually gentrify areas rather than make things more affordable. Of course I'm not very knowledgeable in what makes like a, there's a specific word for it, like a type of place where typically lower income people live, but even then I feel like making a specific part of the city like lower income can lead to a lot of problems like over-policing. I just don't see any real upsides to it. Even if things are made more affordable, I think that it's detrimental in many more areas that would definitely outtake that or overtake that."

      "question": "What impact do you believe increased housing density might have on neighborhood character and quality of life?",
      "answer": "I think it would definitely absolutely change neighborhoods, especially in neighborhoods that have single-family housing. It feels like having far more people in an area that is not ready for that, there would have to be such an insane change of infrastructure. Like, even if one apartment complex was built in the area that I live in, for instance, the schools nearby would not be able to handle that. They're already at capacity. The city would need to be able to afford to accommodate very many more people, for one, because I'm sure people would move to places where it's more affordable. That's what always happens. I feel like quality of life would definitely go down. Again, there are some areas where lots of older people live, and having droves of new people come in and disrupt the flow of things the way that they are is extremely detrimental to people who have lived the same way for very many years. And while I understand that adaptability is important, and people should be able to adapt for the greater good, I don't see this as the greater good. I think that it would take years and years of the city's infrastructure changing in order to accommodate this, and it would be completely detrimental in the meanwhile, in those years of transition. And even then, there's no guaranteeing the city would come out for the better because of it. Neighborhood in particular, yeah, it would be absolutely horrific for several years, maybe even a decade or so. I don't think it's worth it."

      "answer": "There are some cities that have good transportation systems, but again, these are areas that already have Very many apartments areas like New York or Chicago with you know subways or trains Metros for instance things like that like there are plenty of there's public transportation in cities that already need it. However establishing public transportation in cities that don't Sounds Absolutely impossible. I know that in my city for instance. We do not have good public transportation like It's Seemingly impossible to the bus has never come in time People who are trying to commute to make it to things like school and work. It's just not going to work out There are plenty of people who opt to just walk to work because it's so much more viable Than to wait for the bus which is always late and overcrowded and has problems and delays I Think it would make it so much worse Significantly worse and congestion is already not great in cities that don't have big apartment complexes or Upzoning basically like here traffic is a nightmare in a lot of places because it's a city on the border So those border like the word to get to the border on the freeway is always ridiculously congested I can't imagine how terrible it would be. It would become like Los Angeles without even having that many people and There's no way we could establish Public transportation any more functionally without years and years of money and effort. I don't see how this would be a beneficial thing Unless it's in cities. They've already established some sort of public transportation"

      "answer": "I mean, I think it would be entirely up to them to make up for absolutely everything. The public would not have to make up for this if they're doing something like that. It is up to them to fix public transportation. It is up to them to figure out how to manage schools. It's up to them to figure out zoning, because the public does not have a responsibility to be doing that, especially if I think the public would be opposed to that here. Yeah, we have areas with apartments for sure, but those areas tend to be older. They have things that are already established. It would be totally up to local government to establish new things, not just the general public. I don't understand how it would be up to them."

Already trying to get resources for like the general population of a city, like things like the natural gases that you would need, things for energy, electricity, power. I think that upzoning would absolutely be detrimental to the environment, yes. Now that I didn't even consider that, now that I'm thinking about it, that sounds horrific. I worry that there will be a lot more gasoline needed as well in these areas, because people are definitely going to need cars if they wanna get anywhere in time. The oil, the electricity, the water that would be needed even, just it doesn't sound like it would be beneficial to the planet or the people."

      "question": "What economic effects, both positive and negative, might result from changing zoning laws to allow more multi-family housing?",
      "answer": "This I'm less versed in. I don't understand what specific effects might happen, but I can make a couple of guesses maybe. I assume that more local businesses might be able to open up, but the thing is, I don't think that they would be able to compete with monopolies like Walmart or Sam's Club. Things like that. I still do think that local businesses would be wiped out just as easily as they have been. So I can't see very many positives aside from more money going to corporations, which is not a positive in my opinion. I suppose maybe it might benefit something economically for the city, like tax-wise perhaps or something. I can't imagine what. I'm thinking very hard about this and it's taking me a while to think. I'm trying to think of positives. I suppose maybe more professionals would be able to afford living in the city and that could be a net positive and maybe that would have an economic effect, but I really can't think of many positives. I suppose maybe, like was said, rent might become lower, but even with that, property values would go down it would seem. I don't think there are very many positives. There are certainly more net negatives."

      "question": "How do you think the interests of current residents versus future residents should be balanced when making zoning decisions?",
      "answer": "I think the interests of current residents are certainly the most important. We cannot predict the future. We are not time travelers. Sure, we have people who are professionals who can look at patterns and think about how it might go, but we don't know that for certain. We should worry about the people who are living here now and their futures, not potential people who might be here someday. Because once we start thinking in hypotheticals, people are going to start thinking in the way that benefits them, and powerful people, in other words, typically richer people, are going to have more of a say in the future of places. So I think that it would not benefit the people who are already living somewhere to think of future residents' best interests. I think that we should absolutely highlight and focus on the struggles of current residents and their interests and what they need, because adding a bunch of extra people to something that's not entirely functioning just is a recipe for disaster."

      "question": "What role do you think social equity and access to opportunity play in discussions about zoning and housing policy?",
      "answer": "Here it certainly gets more complicated in that yes, definitely people who can't afford to live somewhere need a place that's low income to live. I just don't think that that should be upzoning. I think that yes, low income housing should be established for sure. It would be very helpful. However, doing that in places that already have an established pattern, that already have an established presence, is detrimental to those places and to those people. It's not going to work. However, of course social equity plays a big amount and of course people have a right to have a place to live. People have a right to shelter, a right to food, a right to water, a right to the internet, a right to electricity. And upzoning areas that are already existing will not do that for them. I don't think so. It'll make everything harder for everybody. When it comes to social equity, I think it has everything to do with it and I think everybody deserves equal opportunity, which they won't get if we just start adding low income housing to areas that are already pre-existing. Areas need to be dictated for that or given for that. Again, very ideally by local government to see what would work the best. Perhaps in expanding cities, for instance, where they can build new schools or bigger schools or focus on an area that can be improved."

      "question": "Would small changes in Higher density housing lead to noticeable changes in Support for Upzoning, or would it take larger shifts? Does it have a positive effect (increasing it) or a negative effect (decreasing it)? How strong is this effect?",
      "answer": "This question is a little confusing, so I need to take some time to talk through it and think about it. I think that larger shifts would be very detrimental to the population and the economy and just generally everything here. At least here in my city, I'm considering it from a bigger lens as best I can. I think that smaller changes would probably lead for more support or rather less negativity. I think that if things happened very fast, the negative changes would be very noticeable. Whereas if things happened in very little ways and slowly, perhaps the cities would be able to manage it better and the areas might be able to develop in time. And perhaps people won't realize things are getting worse if they do as quickly. Because people are able to turn a blind eye to things as long as they are doing okay a lot of the time. So it's like people might be blissfully ignorant if it's not affecting them. Whereas if there are these big things, then there will be a lot of people talking about it all at once very vocally and more people will be aware of it. So I think the less people that are aware, the less of an effect it will have generally."

      "answer": "Disruption to community has an extremely negative effect on support for upzoning. And I think it is very, very significant. I can't see anybody wanting things to change in that way. I understand that we do need areas for development, like choose specific areas for lower income housing, for new apartment buildings are affordable. But I can't see anybody wanting things to change like that. I can't see any of the neighborhoods nearby being able to function even remotely with that sort of change. I can't see any of the schools being able to handle it. All I can envision are angry parents with how the schools are going. I can consider angry older residents or distressed older residents with how much everything is changing. I can imagine shops dealing with new competition they haven't dealt with before, ones that are barely staying afloat compared to things like Walmart. I think that disruption is one of the biggest effects and probably the thing people would be the most against or feel the most strong about."

      "answer": "I think it's a significantly strong connection and something that we should think about. It definitely has a negative effect on how I would feel about upzoning because, for instance, my parents are in their late 60s to early 80s, like they are older. I can't see them being able to function that way. I can't see any of where the businesses they used to work at, I can't see that working. I understand that it's important for people to adapt, but I don't think people should have to adapt that significantly, especially in areas that are already established where people have owned homes for over 40, 50 years even. I don't think it's fair to shift things that significantly in established neighbourhoods, old local businesses that have somehow survived things like COVID and monopolies rising, corporations. It doesn't feel fair and it has a very strong effect on me and the way that I feel about it. I assume it would have a very strong effect on them and a very strong effect on their relatives, even relatives living elsewhere. Houses, even single family houses, are already crowded a lot of the time. It's a big family living in one house and the areas are crowded, the schools are crowded, the workplaces, it's already so hard to find a job. I can't see that many, I can't see it working. I can't see it being remotely beneficial for older people."

      "answer": "think that I've been pretty clear on what causes changes in support. For instance, how fast it is, or how slow it is, or how quick, you know, just like how, how little or big the changes are, what, what's put in place to deal with it, how infrastructure changes, if we can work with transportation, that's like a limitless answer. And these influences are both strong and weak, depending, I think that this is all the questions that have already been answered before, basically, I can't like list them all over again."

      "answer": "It's definitely a strong effect. And in areas where most people rent, it would be very beneficial. But in areas where most people own their houses, it has a negative effect. So it really just depends. It's a very strong effect in either a really good or a really bad way, depending on where this happens. In areas where most people rent, yes, upzoning would be great. It would make rent less for those people. And again, maybe it'll make property tax less in other areas, like family-owned houses, things like that. But it would also decrease the value of their property. So yeah, affordability kind of has everything to do with it. I think the biggest benefit would be being able to, for poorer people, for people of lower income, to afford a place to live. That's what's necessary. But we can't do it at the detriment of other people who are already established, because it would just lead to so many problems for everybody, including the low-income people moving in. It's unfortunate."

There's already an energy to it if that makes sense there's already something that people are used to and Change is not something very many people can adapt to very easily like yes We can adapt eventually, but is it something easy to adapt to absolutely not I? Think it would have a rather negative effect I can't see how adding an apartment complex for instance to an Area where there are pretty much just single-family houses Wouldn't not be totally out of place and have this sort of like new Congestion of traffic and new things opening up and everything changing I think the biggest issue is change and that does have a negative effect on things"

      "answer": "Oh, the effect of public transportation is absolutely immediate. It would be terrible. It absolutely takes time to develop a transportation system that works for adding so many new people to an area, especially if the point is to give lower income people a way to exist, a way to thrive. How would they do that without efficient public transportation? It would have an extremely negative effect because either they're going to have to figure out how to get a car. They're going to have to figure out a way to walk to where they need to be for work. They're going to have to figure out a way to walk to school because even the school bus system is out of whack in the area. There's going to have to be so much more. It's going to take so long to develop this. If it were to happen immediately, there would be absolutely no hope.

      "answer": "I mean, a lot of people are blind to environmental concerns to begin with, while it's very important to me, I think it would be the last thing on everybody else's mind for most people's minds. I'm not generalizing here. I think it would be the last thing on people's mind, unfortunately. I would say it has a negative effect. I can't see it having a positive effect of any kind. It's not like more people has ever led to the environment becoming better in human history. To environmentalists, it would certainly decrease support. To general people, I don't think it would have an effect at all. So depending on the person and their morals and how much they care about ethicality and environmental protection, it either is a very strong effect in the negative sense, or for unfortunately, probably the majority or at least a very fair amount of people, it's not going to be something that they think about compared to all the other problems."

I would have the same answer as I did to the last question because to me these two answers are tied in. Natural gases are something that we expend and that we are eventually going to run out of and that's always been the case and people don't think about it or consider it. So yes, I think same answer.

I'm just saying in regards to monopolies that corporations like Walmart, Sam's, things that have already monopolized the industry, they exist and they're already rooting out small businesses. So I don't see how people coming in and opening up new small locally owned businesses would be beneficial to themselves because they might easily be like purged out or like culled by the big corporations in every city or they would just potentially become competition to the already existing and already struggling locally owned businesses that are here. That's what I meant by monopolies."

      "answer": "I mean I feel like if current residents had less things to strive for or hope for or changes that they would need then perhaps it would be easier to accept upzoning. I think that's what I meant by that current residents interest is solving the current issues is necessary before we add more people to an area that's already dysfunctional or a city that's already dysfunctional. Things needs to be in a stable place before adding even more instability to it.

They have a right to survive, a right to electricity, a right to warmth, a right to the internet these days with the way things work. Everyone has their basic human rights. And of course, giving people a place to live is important. I would say that would have a positive effect on the idea of upzoning because it's the only big benefit that I could see and I'm sure a lot of people could see is it would give people who can't afford a place to live and make affording to live easier for people who are struggling. So it's a very strong effect. It's the one big positive that exists in all this."

But if negative changes happen to them, if things change in their lives and there's more chaos and change added to it, then that would be a negative effect. And it would be pretty strong either way.

So it's very hard already to deal with how many kids are in so many schools that already exist here. Adding even more to a certain area would totally overflow the school system. Like there would be no way to give attention to the kids who need it. There would be no way to have enough teachers. The classes are already so big, the sizes of the classes, I mean. And it would be immediate, especially if many people move in all at once. It would be a very negative effect. And I would say it's pretty strong.

      "answer": "I don't really understand this question either. The main cause of single-family neighborhoods are just that they were already pre-established to begin with. In the past, homes used to be affordable, so it made sense to live the typical quote-unquote American dream and get your white picket fence little home with a single earner earning all the income for a family and being able to support a family of four on just one income. That's not possible anymore. So I would say that the cause of single-family neighborhoods is a time before everything was as ridiculously priced as it is now. It's not feasible anymore, but it used to be at least somewhat feasible in the past. Now it's basically impossible to be able to do that. So the cause of it is just it's pre-established. It already existed decades and decades ago. I would say that these influences just are. I don't think it's a positive or negative influence on cities. I think that it's nice to have areas like that. It's certainly incredibly expensive to live there, and rent is impossible to afford there, but I don't think that adding to those neighborhoods something that will decrease them in value is beneficial to anybody.

      "answer": "So, I think this significantly interrupts things. Of course, I'm thinking in terms of my own neighborhood, which I grew up in, and now after having returned from university, live in again, and it has always been single family neighborhoods in this whole area. I think there's an area with apartments further away, but it's the densest part of the city, and living there is kind of not the greatest. It's very stressful to try and find parking, and I know because I have friends that live there. Stores don't seem to be doing all that much better because so many more of them are open, so it kind of feels like the same thing, only it's just really hard to pick and choose where to go. I think that the biggest thing is it really would disrupt things. Change doesn't happen that rapidly. It happens very slowly, and those years of disruption would absolutely be very detrimental to the people living in this area, especially because there are lots of older people living here. So, I think that considering on a case-by-case basis, yes, there definitely are going to be some areas in which higher density housing would work, for instance, in bigger cities that already have higher density areas. But I think in even just generally urban, like not big cities, but like suburban areas, I do not think that it would work, and I would somewhat oppose it in those areas. Again, really dense areas like New York, Chicago, sure, I would support it, Atlanta. Cities where there genuinely is like overcapacity, like Phoenix maybe, but generally, I would not support it, no."

It kind of feels like, even though I know it's going to be more affordable, it somewhat feels like it's going to completely change the area, and it'll take a very long time for it to get back to normal. I think that those are the negative impacts. Positive, yes, rent would go down for sure. However, there are lots of places in which people don't rent their houses or apartments. So I think it would be really detrimental to property value, for instance, if people who own their houses, all of a sudden, they're going to be worth a lot less, it seems. I don't see how it could be beneficial in very many areas."

      "answer": "I think that it would make things more affordable, again maybe in terms of rent, but then I think about places like New York City where the apartments are, I mean there are plenty of them, but they're ridiculously expensive. I worry about the kinds of people that might move in and worry that it might actually gentrify areas rather than make things more affordable. Of course I'm not very knowledgeable in what makes like a, there's a specific word for it, like a type of place where typically lower income people live, but even then I feel like making a specific part of the city like lower income can lead to a lot of problems like over-policing. I just don't see any real upsides to it. Even if things are made more affordable, I think that it's detrimental in many more areas that would definitely outtake that or overtake that."

      "question": "What impact do you believe increased housing density might have on neighborhood character and quality of life?",
      "answer": "I think it would definitely absolutely change neighborhoods, especially in neighborhoods that have single-family housing. It feels like having far more people in an area that is not ready for that, there would have to be such an insane change of infrastructure. Like, even if one apartment complex was built in the area that I live in, for instance, the schools nearby would not be able to handle that. They're already at capacity. The city would need to be able to afford to accommodate very many more people, for one, because I'm sure people would move to places where it's more affordable. That's what always happens. I feel like quality of life would definitely go down. Again, there are some areas where lots of older people live, and having droves of new people come in and disrupt the flow of things the way that they are is extremely detrimental to people who have lived the same way for very many years. And while I understand that adaptability is important, and people should be able to adapt for the greater good, I don't see this as the greater good. I think that it would take years and years of the city's infrastructure changing in order to accommodate this, and it would be completely detrimental in the meanwhile, in those years of transition. And even then, there's no guaranteeing the city would come out for the better because of it. Neighborhood in particular, yeah, it would be absolutely horrific for several years, maybe even a decade or so. I don't think it's worth it."

      "answer": "There are some cities that have good transportation systems, but again, these are areas that already have Very many apartments areas like New York or Chicago with you know subways or trains Metros for instance things like that like there are plenty of there's public transportation in cities that already need it. However establishing public transportation in cities that don't Sounds Absolutely impossible. I know that in my city for instance. We do not have good public transportation like It's Seemingly impossible to the bus has never come in time People who are trying to commute to make it to things like school and work. It's just not going to work out There are plenty of people who opt to just walk to work because it's so much more viable Than to wait for the bus which is always late and overcrowded and has problems and delays I Think it would make it so much worse Significantly worse and congestion is already not great in cities that don't have big apartment complexes or Upzoning basically like here traffic is a nightmare in a lot of places because it's a city on the border So those border like the word to get to the border on the freeway is always ridiculously congested I can't imagine how terrible it would be. It would become like Los Angeles without even having that many people and There's no way we could establish Public transportation any more functionally without years and years of money and effort. I don't see how this would be a beneficial thing Unless it's in cities. They've already established some sort of public transportation"

      "answer": "I mean, I think it would be entirely up to them to make up for absolutely everything. The public would not have to make up for this if they're doing something like that. It is up to them to fix public transportation. It is up to them to figure out how to manage schools. It's up to them to figure out zoning, because the public does not have a responsibility to be doing that, especially if I think the public would be opposed to that here. Yeah, we have areas with apartments for sure, but those areas tend to be older. They have things that are already established. It would be totally up to local government to establish new things, not just the general public. I don't understand how it would be up to them."

Already trying to get resources for like the general population of a city, like things like the natural gases that you would need, things for energy, electricity, power. I think that upzoning would absolutely be detrimental to the environment, yes. Now that I didn't even consider that, now that I'm thinking about it, that sounds horrific. I worry that there will be a lot more gasoline needed as well in these areas, because people are definitely going to need cars if they wanna get anywhere in time. The oil, the electricity, the water that would be needed even, just it doesn't sound like it would be beneficial to the planet or the people."

      "question": "What economic effects, both positive and negative, might result from changing zoning laws to allow more multi-family housing?",
      "answer": "This I'm less versed in. I don't understand what specific effects might happen, but I can make a couple of guesses maybe. I assume that more local businesses might be able to open up, but the thing is, I don't think that they would be able to compete with monopolies like Walmart or Sam's Club. Things like that. I still do think that local businesses would be wiped out just as easily as they have been. So I can't see very many positives aside from more money going to corporations, which is not a positive in my opinion. I suppose maybe it might benefit something economically for the city, like tax-wise perhaps or something. I can't imagine what. I'm thinking very hard about this and it's taking me a while to think. I'm trying to think of positives. I suppose maybe more professionals would be able to afford living in the city and that could be a net positive and maybe that would have an economic effect, but I really can't think of many positives. I suppose maybe, like was said, rent might become lower, but even with that, property values would go down it would seem. I don't think there are very many positives. There are certainly more net negatives."

      "question": "How do you think the interests of current residents versus future residents should be balanced when making zoning decisions?",
      "answer": "I think the interests of current residents are certainly the most important. We cannot predict the future. We are not time travelers. Sure, we have people who are professionals who can look at patterns and think about how it might go, but we don't know that for certain. We should worry about the people who are living here now and their futures, not potential people who might be here someday. Because once we start thinking in hypotheticals, people are going to start thinking in the way that benefits them, and powerful people, in other words, typically richer people, are going to have more of a say in the future of places. So I think that it would not benefit the people who are already living somewhere to think of future residents' best interests. I think that we should absolutely highlight and focus on the struggles of current residents and their interests and what they need, because adding a bunch of extra people to something that's not entirely functioning just is a recipe for disaster."

      "question": "What role do you think social equity and access to opportunity play in discussions about zoning and housing policy?",
      "answer": "Here it certainly gets more complicated in that yes, definitely people who can't afford to live somewhere need a place that's low income to live. I just don't think that that should be upzoning. I think that yes, low income housing should be established for sure. It would be very helpful. However, doing that in places that already have an established pattern, that already have an established presence, is detrimental to those places and to those people. It's not going to work. However, of course social equity plays a big amount and of course people have a right to have a place to live. People have a right to shelter, a right to food, a right to water, a right to the internet, a right to electricity. And upzoning areas that are already existing will not do that for them. I don't think so. It'll make everything harder for everybody. When it comes to social equity, I think it has everything to do with it and I think everybody deserves equal opportunity, which they won't get if we just start adding low income housing to areas that are already pre-existing. Areas need to be dictated for that or given for that. Again, very ideally by local government to see what would work the best. Perhaps in expanding cities, for instance, where they can build new schools or bigger schools or focus on an area that can be improved."

      "question": "Would small changes in Higher density housing lead to noticeable changes in Support for Upzoning, or would it take larger shifts? Does it have a positive effect (increasing it) or a negative effect (decreasing it)? How strong is this effect?",
      "answer": "This question is a little confusing, so I need to take some time to talk through it and think about it. I think that larger shifts would be very detrimental to the population and the economy and just generally everything here. At least here in my city, I'm considering it from a bigger lens as best I can. I think that smaller changes would probably lead for more support or rather less negativity. I think that if things happened very fast, the negative changes would be very noticeable. Whereas if things happened in very little ways and slowly, perhaps the cities would be able to manage it better and the areas might be able to develop in time. And perhaps people won't realize things are getting worse if they do as quickly. Because people are able to turn a blind eye to things as long as they are doing okay a lot of the time. So it's like people might be blissfully ignorant if it's not affecting them. Whereas if there are these big things, then there will be a lot of people talking about it all at once very vocally and more people will be aware of it. So I think the less people that are aware, the less of an effect it will have generally."

      "answer": "Disruption to community has an extremely negative effect on support for upzoning. And I think it is very, very significant. I can't see anybody wanting things to change in that way. I understand that we do need areas for development, like choose specific areas for lower income housing, for new apartment buildings are affordable. But I can't see anybody wanting things to change like that. I can't see any of the neighborhoods nearby being able to function even remotely with that sort of change. I can't see any of the schools being able to handle it. All I can envision are angry parents with how the schools are going. I can consider angry older residents or distressed older residents with how much everything is changing. I can imagine shops dealing with new competition they haven't dealt with before, ones that are barely staying afloat compared to things like Walmart. I think that disruption is one of the biggest effects and probably the thing people would be the most against or feel the most strong about."

      "answer": "I think it's a significantly strong connection and something that we should think about. It definitely has a negative effect on how I would feel about upzoning because, for instance, my parents are in their late 60s to early 80s, like they are older. I can't see them being able to function that way. I can't see any of where the businesses they used to work at, I can't see that working. I understand that it's important for people to adapt, but I don't think people should have to adapt that significantly, especially in areas that are already established where people have owned homes for over 40, 50 years even. I don't think it's fair to shift things that significantly in established neighbourhoods, old local businesses that have somehow survived things like COVID and monopolies rising, corporations. It doesn't feel fair and it has a very strong effect on me and the way that I feel about it. I assume it would have a very strong effect on them and a very strong effect on their relatives, even relatives living elsewhere. Houses, even single family houses, are already crowded a lot of the time. It's a big family living in one house and the areas are crowded, the schools are crowded, the workplaces, it's already so hard to find a job. I can't see that many, I can't see it working. I can't see it being remotely beneficial for older people."

For instance, how fast it is, or how slow it is, or how quick, you know, just like how, how little or big the changes are, what, what's put in place to deal with it, how infrastructure changes, if we can work with transportation, that's like a limitless answer. And these influences are both strong and weak, depending, I think that this is all the questions that have already been answered before, basically, I can't like list them all over again."

      "answer": "It's definitely a strong effect. And in areas where most people rent, it would be very beneficial. But in areas where most people own their houses, it has a negative effect. So it really just depends. It's a very strong effect in either a really good or a really bad way, depending on where this happens. In areas where most people rent, yes, upzoning would be great. It would make rent less for those people. And again, maybe it'll make property tax less in other areas, like family-owned houses, things like that. But it would also decrease the value of their property. So yeah, affordability kind of has everything to do with it. I think the biggest benefit would be being able to, for poorer people, for people of lower income, to afford a place to live. That's what's necessary. But we can't do it at the detriment of other people who are already established, because it would just lead to so many problems for everybody, including the low-income people moving in. It's unfortunate."

There's already an energy to it if that makes sense there's already something that people are used to and Change is not something very many people can adapt to very easily like yes We can adapt eventually, but is it something easy to adapt to absolutely not I? Think it would have a rather negative effect I can't see how adding an apartment complex for instance to an Area where there are pretty much just single-family houses Wouldn't not be totally out of place and have this sort of like new Congestion of traffic and new things opening up and everything changing I think the biggest issue is change and that does have a negative effect on things"

      "answer": "Oh, the effect of public transportation is absolutely immediate. It would be terrible. It absolutely takes time to develop a transportation system that works for adding so many new people to an area, especially if the point is to give lower income people a way to exist, a way to thrive. How would they do that without efficient public transportation? It would have an extremely negative effect because either they're going to have to figure out how to get a car. They're going to have to figure out a way to walk to where they need to be for work. They're going to have to figure out a way to walk to school because even the school bus system is out of whack in the area. There's going to have to be so much more. It's going to take so long to develop this. If it were to happen immediately, there would be absolutely no hope.

      "answer": "I mean, a lot of people are blind to environmental concerns to begin with, while it's very important to me, I think it would be the last thing on everybody else's mind for most people's minds. I'm not generalizing here. I think it would be the last thing on people's mind, unfortunately. I would say it has a negative effect. I can't see it having a positive effect of any kind. It's not like more people has ever led to the environment becoming better in human history. To environmentalists, it would certainly decrease support. To general people, I don't think it would have an effect at all. So depending on the person and their morals and how much they care about ethicality and environmental protection, it either is a very strong effect in the negative sense, or for unfortunately, probably the majority or at least a very fair amount of people, it's not going to be something that they think about compared to all the other problems."

I would have the same answer as I did to the last question because to me these two answers are tied in. Natural gases are something that we expend and that we are eventually going to run out of and that's always been the case and people don't think about it or consider it. So yes, I think same answer.

I'm just saying in regards to monopolies that corporations like Walmart, Sam's, things that have already monopolized the industry, they exist and they're already rooting out small businesses. So I don't see how people coming in and opening up new small locally owned businesses would be beneficial to themselves because they might easily be like purged out or like culled by the big corporations in every city or they would just potentially become competition to the already existing and already struggling locally owned businesses that are here. That's what I meant by monopolies."

      "answer": "I mean I feel like if current residents had less things to strive for or hope for or changes that they would need then perhaps it would be easier to accept upzoning. I think that's what I meant by that current residents interest is solving the current issues is necessary before we add more people to an area that's already dysfunctional or a city that's already dysfunctional. Things needs to be in a stable place before adding even more instability to it.

They have a right to survive, a right to electricity, a right to warmth, a right to the internet these days with the way things work. Everyone has their basic human rights. And of course, giving people a place to live is important. I would say that would have a positive effect on the idea of upzoning because it's the only big benefit that I could see and I'm sure a lot of people could see is it would give people who can't afford a place to live and make affording to live easier for people who are struggling. So it's a very strong effect. It's the one big positive that exists in all this."

But if negative changes happen to them, if things change in their lives and there's more chaos and change added to it, then that would be a negative effect. And it would be pretty strong either way.

So it's very hard already to deal with how many kids are in so many schools that already exist here. Adding even more to a certain area would totally overflow the school system. Like there would be no way to give attention to the kids who need it. There would be no way to have enough teachers. The classes are already so big, the sizes of the classes, I mean. And it would be immediate, especially if many people move in all at once. It would be a very negative effect. And I would say it's pretty strong.

      "answer": "I don't really understand this question either. The main cause of single-family neighborhoods are just that they were already pre-established to begin with. In the past, homes used to be affordable, so it made sense to live the typical quote-unquote American dream and get your white picket fence little home with a single earner earning all the income for a family and being able to support a family of four on just one income. That's not possible anymore. So I would say that the cause of single-family neighborhoods is a time before everything was as ridiculously priced as it is now. It's not feasible anymore, but it used to be at least somewhat feasible in the past. Now it's basically impossible to be able to do that. So the cause of it is just it's pre-established. It already existed decades and decades ago. I would say that these influences just are. I don't think it's a positive or negative influence on cities. I think that it's nice to have areas like that. It's certainly incredibly expensive to live there, and rent is impossible to afford there, but I don't think that adding to those neighborhoods something that will decrease them in value is beneficial to anybody.

It's very stressful to try and find parking, and I know because I have friends that live there. Stores don't seem to be doing all that much better because so many more of them are open, so it kind of feels like the same thing, only it's just really hard to pick and choose where to go.

It happens very slowly, and those years of disruption would absolutely be very detrimental to the people living in this area, especially because there are lots of older people living here. So, I think that considering on a case-by-case basis, yes, there definitely are going to be some areas in which higher density housing would work, for instance, in bigger cities that already have higher density areas. But I think in even just generally urban, like not big cities, but like suburban areas, I do not think that it would work, and I would somewhat oppose it in those areas. Again, really dense areas like New York, Chicago, sure, I would support it, Atlanta. Cities where there genuinely is like overcapacity, like Phoenix maybe, but generally, I would not support it, no."

      "answer": "I think that overcrowding is a big concern for me. I also think that older people would not be able to adapt as well. I think that the already existing businesses, which are doing just fine, would have a hard time competing with all the new ones that came in, maybe more modern ones. It kind of feels like, even though I know it's going to be more affordable, it somewhat feels like it's going to completely change the area, and it'll take a very long time for it to get back to normal. I think that those are the negative impacts. Positive, yes, rent would go down for sure. However, there are lots of places in which people don't rent their houses or apartments. So I think it would be really detrimental to property value, for instance, if people who own their houses, all of a sudden, they're going to be worth a lot less, it seems. I don't see how it could be beneficial in very many areas."

      "question": "How do you think upzoning policies might affect housing affordability in urban areas?",
      "answer": "I think that it would make things more affordable, again maybe in terms of rent, but then I think about places like New York City where the apartments are, I mean there are plenty of them, but they're ridiculously expensive. I worry about the kinds of people that might move in and worry that it might actually gentrify areas rather than make things more affordable. Of course I'm not very knowledgeable in what makes like a, there's a specific word for it, like a type of place where typically lower income people live, but even then I feel like making a specific part of the city like lower income can lead to a lot of problems like over-policing. I just don't see any real upsides to it. Even if things are made more affordable, I think that it's detrimental in many more areas that would definitely outtake that or overtake that."

    {
      "question_number": "4",
      "question": "What impact do you believe increased housing density might have on neighborhood character and quality of life?",
      "answer": "I think it would definitely absolutely change neighborhoods, especially in neighborhoods that have single-family housing. It feels like having far more people in an area that is not ready for that, there would have to be such an insane change of infrastructure. Like, even if one apartment complex was built in the area that I live in, for instance, the schools nearby would not be able to handle that. They're already at capacity. The city would need to be able to afford to accommodate very many more people, for one, because I'm sure people would move to places where it's more affordable. That's what always happens. I feel like quality of life would definitely go down. Again, there are some areas where lots of older people live, and having droves of new people come in and disrupt the flow of things the way that they are is extremely detrimental to people who have lived the same way for very many years. And while I understand that adaptability is important, and people should be able to adapt for the greater good, I don't see this as the greater good. I think that it would take years and years of the city's infrastructure changing in order to accommodate this, and it would be completely detrimental in the meanwhile, in those years of transition. And even then, there's no guaranteeing the city would come out for the better because of it. Neighborhood in particular, yeah, it would be absolutely horrific for several years, maybe even a decade or so. I don't think it's worth it."

      "answer": "There are some cities that have good transportation systems, but again, these are areas that already have Very many apartments areas like New York or Chicago with you know subways or trains Metros for instance things like that like there are plenty of there's public transportation in cities that already need it. However establishing public transportation in cities that don't Sounds Absolutely impossible. I know that in my city for instance. We do not have good public transportation like It's Seemingly impossible to the bus has never come in time People who are trying to commute to make it to things like school and work. It's just not going to work out There are plenty of people who opt to just walk to work because it's so much more viable Than to wait for the bus which is always late and overcrowded and has problems and delays I Think it would make it so much worse Significantly worse and congestion is already not great in cities that don't have big apartment complexes or Upzoning basically like here traffic is a nightmare in a lot of places because it's a city on the border So those border like the word to get to the border on the freeway is always ridiculously congested I can't imagine how terrible it would be. It would become like Los Angeles without even having that many people and There's no way we could establish Public transportation any more functionally without years and years of money and effort. I don't see how this would be a beneficial thing Unless it's in cities. They've already established some sort of public transportation"

      "question_number": "6",
      "question": "What role do you believe local government should play in regulating housing development and density?",
      "answer": "I mean, I think it would be entirely up to them to make up for absolutely everything. The public would not have to make up for this if they're doing something like that. It is up to them to fix public transportation. It is up to them to figure out how to manage schools. It's up to them to figure out zoning, because the public does not have a responsibility to be doing that, especially if I think the public would be opposed to that here. Yeah, we have areas with apartments for sure, but those areas tend to be older. They have things that are already established. It would be totally up to local government to establish new things, not just the general public. I don't understand how it would be up to them."

      "answer": "Oh, I am significantly concerned about that. Already trying to get resources for like the general population of a city, like things like the natural gases that you would need, things for energy, electricity, power. I think that upzoning would absolutely be detrimental to the environment, yes. Now that I didn't even consider that, now that I'm thinking about it, that sounds horrific. I worry that there will be a lot more gasoline needed as well in these areas, because people are definitely going to need cars if they wanna get anywhere in time. The oil, the electricity, the water that would be needed even, just it doesn't sound like it would be beneficial to the planet or the people."
    },
    {
      "question_number": "9",
      "question": "How do you think the interests of current residents versus future residents should be balanced when making zoning decisions?",
      "answer": "I think the interests of current residents are certainly the most important. We cannot predict the future. We are not time travelers. Sure, we have people who are professionals who can look at patterns and think about how it might go, but we don't know that for certain. We should worry about the people who are living here now and their futures, not potential people who might be here someday. Because once we start thinking in hypotheticals, people are going to start thinking in the way that benefits them, and powerful people, in other words, typically richer people, are going to have more of a say in the future of places. So I think that it would not benefit the people who are already living somewhere to think of future residents' best interests. I think that we should absolutely highlight and focus on the struggles of current residents and their interests and what they need, because adding a bunch of extra people to something that's not entirely functioning just is a recipe for disaster."

      "question_number": "10",
      "question": "What role do you think social equity and access to opportunity play in discussions about zoning and housing policy?",
      "answer": "Here it certainly gets more complicated in that yes, definitely people who can't afford to live somewhere need a place that's low income to live. I just don't think that that should be upzoning. I think that yes, low income housing should be established for sure. It would be very helpful. However, doing that in places that already have an established pattern, that already have an established presence, is detrimental to those places and to those people. It's not going to work. However, of course social equity plays a big amount and of course people have a right to have a place to live. People have a right to shelter, a right to food, a right to water, a right to the internet, a right to electricity. And upzoning areas that are already existing will not do that for them. I don't think so. It'll make everything harder for everybody. When it comes to social equity, I think it has everything to do with it and I think everybody deserves equal opportunity, which they won't get if we just start adding low income housing to areas that are already pre-existing. Areas need to be dictated for that or given for that. Again, very ideally by local government to see what would work the best. Perhaps in expanding cities, for instance, where they can build new schools or bigger schools or focus on an area that can be improved."

      "question": "Would small changes in Higher density housing lead to noticeable changes in Support for Upzoning, or would it take larger shifts? Does it have a positive effect (increasing it) or a negative effect (decreasing it)? How strong is this effect?",
      "answer": "This question is a little confusing, so I need to take some time to talk through it and think about it. I think that larger shifts would be very detrimental to the population and the economy and just generally everything here. At least here in my city, I'm considering it from a bigger lens as best I can. I think that smaller changes would probably lead for more support or rather less negativity. I think that if things happened very fast, the negative changes would be very noticeable. Whereas if things happened in very little ways and slowly, perhaps the cities would be able to manage it better and the areas might be able to develop in time. And perhaps people won't realize things are getting worse if they do as quickly. Because people are able to turn a blind eye to things as long as they are doing okay a lot of the time. So it's like people might be blissfully ignorant if it's not affecting them. Whereas if there are these big things, then there will be a lot of people talking about it all at once very vocally and more people will be aware of it. So I think the less people that are aware, the less of an effect it will have generally."

      "answer": "Disruption to community has an extremely negative effect on support for upzoning. And I think it is very, very significant. I can't see anybody wanting things to change in that way. I understand that we do need areas for development, like choose specific areas for lower income housing, for new apartment buildings are affordable. But I can't see anybody wanting things to change like that. I can't see any of the neighborhoods nearby being able to function even remotely with that sort of change. I can't see any of the schools being able to handle it. All I can envision are angry parents with how the schools are going. I can consider angry older residents or distressed older residents with how much everything is changing. I can imagine shops dealing with new competition they haven't dealt with before, ones that are barely staying afloat compared to things like Walmart. I think that disruption is one of the biggest effects and probably the thing people would be the most against or feel the most strong about."

      "answer": "I think it's a significantly strong connection and something that we should think about. It definitely has a negative effect on how I would feel about upzoning because, for instance, my parents are in their late 60s to early 80s, like they are older. I can't see them being able to function that way. I can't see any of where the businesses they used to work at, I can't see that working. I understand that it's important for people to adapt, but I don't think people should have to adapt that significantly, especially in areas that are already established where people have owned homes for over 40, 50 years even. I don't think it's fair to shift things that significantly in established neighbourhoods, old local businesses that have somehow survived things like COVID and monopolies rising, corporations. It doesn't feel fair and it has a very strong effect on me and the way that I feel about it. I assume it would have a very strong effect on them and a very strong effect on their relatives, even relatives living elsewhere. Houses, even single family houses, are already crowded a lot of the time. It's a big family living in one house and the areas are crowded, the schools are crowded, the workplaces, it's already so hard to find a job. I can't see that many, I can't see it working. I can't see it being remotely beneficial for older people."

      "answer": "think that I've been pretty clear on what causes changes in support. For instance, how fast it is, or how slow it is, or how quick, you know, just like how, how little or big the changes are, what, what's put in place to deal with it, how infrastructure changes, if we can work with transportation, that's like a limitless answer. And these influences are both strong and weak, depending, I think that this is all the questions that have already been answered before, basically, I can't like list them all over again."

      "answer": "It's definitely a strong effect. And in areas where most people rent, it would be very beneficial. But in areas where most people own their houses, it has a negative effect. So it really just depends. It's a very strong effect in either a really good or a really bad way, depending on where this happens. In areas where most people rent, yes, upzoning would be great. It would make rent less for those people. And again, maybe it'll make property tax less in other areas, like family-owned houses, things like that. But it would also decrease the value of their property. So yeah, affordability kind of has everything to do with it. I think the biggest benefit would be being able to, for poorer people, for people of lower income, to afford a place to live. That's what's necessary. But we can't do it at the detriment of other people who are already established, because it would just lead to so many problems for everybody, including the low-income people moving in. It's unfortunate."

There's already an energy to it if that makes sense there's already something that people are used to and Change is not something very many people can adapt to very easily like yes We can adapt eventually, but is it something easy to adapt to absolutely not I? Think it would have a rather negative effect I can't see how adding an apartment complex for instance to an Area where there are pretty much just single-family houses Wouldn't not be totally out of place and have this sort of like new Congestion of traffic and new things opening up and everything changing I think the biggest issue is change and that does have a negative effect on things"

      "answer": "Oh, the effect of public transportation is absolutely immediate. It would be terrible. It absolutely takes time to develop a transportation system that works for adding so many new people to an area, especially if the point is to give lower income people a way to exist, a way to thrive. How would they do that without efficient public transportation? It would have an extremely negative effect because either they're going to have to figure out how to get a car. They're going to have to figure out a way to walk to where they need to be for work. They're going to have to figure out a way to walk to school because even the school bus system is out of whack in the area. There's going to have to be so much more. It's going to take so long to develop this. If it were to happen immediately, there would be absolutely no hope. It has an extremely negative impact unless the city already has an established and efficient public transportation system."

      "answer": "I mean, a lot of people are blind to environmental concerns to begin with, while it's very important to me, I think it would be the last thing on everybody else's mind for most people's minds. I'm not generalizing here. I think it would be the last thing on people's mind, unfortunately. I would say it has a negative effect. I can't see it having a positive effect of any kind. It's not like more people has ever led to the environment becoming better in human history. To environmentalists, it would certainly decrease support. To general people, I don't think it would have an effect at all. So depending on the person and their morals and how much they care about ethicality and environmental protection, it either is a very strong effect in the negative sense, or for unfortunately, probably the majority or at least a very fair amount of people, it's not going to be something that they think about compared to all the other problems."

I would have the same answer as I did to the last question because to me these two answers are tied in. Natural gases are something that we expend and that we are eventually going to run out of and that's always been the case and people don't think about it or consider it. So yes, I think same answer. Depending on how environmentally ethical you are, it either has a strong negative effect or other people won't even think about it."

      "answer": "I don't understand what changes in monopolies means. I'm just saying in regards to monopolies that corporations like Walmart, Sam's, things that have already monopolized the industry, they exist and they're already rooting out small businesses. So I don't see how people coming in and opening up new small locally owned businesses would be beneficial to themselves because they might easily be like purged out or like culled by the big corporations in every city or they would just potentially become competition to the already existing and already struggling locally owned businesses that are here. That's what I meant by monopolies."

      "answer": "I mean I feel like if current residents had less things to strive for or hope for or changes that they would need then perhaps it would be easier to accept upzoning. I think that's what I meant by that current residents interest is solving the current issues is necessary before we add more people to an area that's already dysfunctional or a city that's already dysfunctional. Things needs to be in a stable place before adding even more instability to it. So I would say it has a pretty strong effect because content people are more likely to accept change than people who are already having a hard time or are already angry about something."

They have a right to survive, a right to electricity, a right to warmth, a right to the internet these days with the way things work. Everyone has their basic human rights. And of course, giving people a place to live is important. I would say that would have a positive effect on the idea of upzoning because it's the only big benefit that I could see and I'm sure a lot of people could see is it would give people who can't afford a place to live and make affording to live easier for people who are struggling. So it's a very strong effect. It's the one big positive that exists in all this."

I mean, I feel like as long as areas where, if already pre-established areas where lots of people who have been living here for a long time live remain untouched, that might lead to more support. But if negative changes happen to them, if things change in their lives and there's more chaos and change added to it, then that would be a negative effect. And it would be pretty strong either way.

So it's very hard already to deal with how many kids are in so many schools that already exist here. Adding even more to a certain area would totally overflow the school system. Like there would be no way to give attention to the kids who need it. There would be no way to have enough teachers. The classes are already so big, the sizes of the classes, I mean. And it would be immediate, especially if many people move in all at once. It would be a very negative effect. And I would say it's pretty strong.

      "answer": "I don't really understand this question either. The main cause of single-family neighborhoods are just that they were already pre-established to begin with. In the past, homes used to be affordable, so it made sense to live the typical quote-unquote American dream and get your white picket fence little home with a single earner earning all the income for a family and being able to support a family of four on just one income. That's not possible anymore. So I would say that the cause of single-family neighborhoods is a time before everything was as ridiculously priced as it is now. It's not feasible anymore, but it used to be at least somewhat feasible in the past. Now it's basically impossible to be able to do that. So the cause of it is just it's pre-established. It already existed decades and decades ago. I would say that these influences just are. I don't think it's a positive or negative influence on cities. I think that it's nice to have areas like that. It's certainly incredibly expensive to live there, and rent is impossible to afford there, but I don't think that adding to those neighborhoods something that will decrease them in value is beneficial to anybody.

Of course, I'm thinking in terms of my own neighborhood, which I grew up in, and now after having returned from university, live in again, and it has always been single family neighborhoods in this whole area. I think there's an area with apartments further away, but it's the densest part of the city, and living there is kind of not the greatest. It's very stressful to try and find parking, and I know because I have friends that live there. Stores don't seem to be doing all that much better because so many more of them are open, so it kind of feels like the same thing, only it's just really hard to pick and choose where to go. I think that the biggest thing is it really would disrupt things. Change doesn't happen that rapidly. It happens very slowly, and those years of disruption would absolutely be very detrimental to the people living in this area, especially because there are lots of older people living here. So, I think that considering on a case-by-case basis, yes, there definitely are going to be some areas in which higher density housing would work, for instance, in bigger cities that already have higher density areas. But I think in even just generally urban, like not big cities, but like suburban areas, I do not think that it would work, and I would somewhat oppose it in those areas. Again, really dense areas like New York, Chicago, sure, I would support it, Atlanta. Cities where there genuinely is like overcapacity, like Phoenix maybe, but generally, I would not support it, no."

      "answer": "I think that overcrowding is a big concern for me. I also think that older people would not be able to adapt as well. I think that the already existing businesses, which are doing just fine, would have a hard time competing with all the new ones that came in, maybe more modern ones. It kind of feels like, even though I know it's going to be more affordable, it somewhat feels like it's going to completely change the area, and it'll take a very long time for it to get back to normal. I think that those are the negative impacts. Positive, yes, rent would go down for sure. However, there are lots of places in which people don't rent their houses or apartments. So I think it would be really detrimental to property value, for instance, if people who own their houses, all of a sudden, they're going to be worth a lot less, it seems. I don't see how it could be beneficial in very many areas."

      "question": "How do you think upzoning policies might affect housing affordability in urban areas?",
      "answer": "I think that it would make things more affordable, again maybe in terms of rent, but then I think about places like New York City where the apartments are, I mean there are plenty of them, but they're ridiculously expensive. I worry about the kinds of people that might move in and worry that it might actually gentrify areas rather than make things more affordable. Of course I'm not very knowledgeable in what makes like a, there's a specific word for it, like a type of place where typically lower income people live, but even then I feel like making a specific part of the city like lower income can lead to a lot of problems like over-policing. I just don't see any real upsides to it. Even if things are made more affordable, I think that it's detrimental in many more areas that would definitely outtake that or overtake that."

    {
      "question_number": "4",
      "question": "What impact do you believe increased housing density might have on neighborhood character and quality of life?",
      "answer": "I think it would definitely absolutely change neighborhoods, especially in neighborhoods that have single-family housing. It feels like having far more people in an area that is not ready for that, there would have to be such an insane change of infrastructure. Like, even if one apartment complex was built in the area that I live in, for instance, the schools nearby would not be able to handle that. They're already at capacity. The city would need to be able to afford to accommodate very many more people, for one, because I'm sure people would move to places where it's more affordable. That's what always happens. I feel like quality of life would definitely go down. Again, there are some areas where lots of older people live, and having droves of new people come in and disrupt the flow of things the way that they are is extremely detrimental to people who have lived the same way for very many years. And while I understand that adaptability is important, and people should be able to adapt for the greater good, I don't see this as the greater good. I think that it would take years and years of the city's infrastructure changing in order to accommodate this, and it would be completely detrimental in the meanwhile, in those years of transition. And even then, there's no guaranteeing the city would come out for the better because of it. Neighborhood in particular, yeah, it would be absolutely horrific for several years, maybe even a decade or so. I don't think it's worth it."

      "answer": "There are some cities that have good transportation systems, but again, these are areas that already have Very many apartments areas like New York or Chicago with you know subways or trains Metros for instance things like that like there are plenty of there's public transportation in cities that already need it. However establishing public transportation in cities that don't Sounds Absolutely impossible. I know that in my city for instance. We do not have good public transportation like It's Seemingly impossible to the bus has never come in time People who are trying to commute to make it to things like school and work. It's just not going to work out There are plenty of people who opt to just walk to work because it's so much more viable Than to wait for the bus which is always late and overcrowded and has problems and delays I Think it would make it so much worse Significantly worse and congestion is already not great in cities that don't have big apartment complexes or Upzoning basically like here traffic is a nightmare in a lot of places because it's a city on the border So those border like the word to get to the border on the freeway is always ridiculously congested I can't imagine how terrible it would be. It would become like Los Angeles without even having that many people and There's no way we could establish Public transportation any more functionally without years and years of money and effort. I don't see how this would be a beneficial thing Unless it's in cities. They've already established some sort of public transportation"

      "question_number": "6",
      "question": "What role do you believe local government should play in regulating housing development and density?",
      "answer": "I mean, I think it would be entirely up to them to make up for absolutely everything. The public would not have to make up for this if they're doing something like that. It is up to them to fix public transportation. It is up to them to figure out how to manage schools. It's up to them to figure out zoning, because the public does not have a responsibility to be doing that, especially if I think the public would be opposed to that here. Yeah, we have areas with apartments for sure, but those areas tend to be older. They have things that are already established. It would be totally up to local government to establish new things, not just the general public. I don't understand how it would be up to them."

      "answer": "Oh, I am significantly concerned about that. Already trying to get resources for like the general population of a city, like things like the natural gases that you would need, things for energy, electricity, power. I think that upzoning would absolutely be detrimental to the environment, yes. Now that I didn't even consider that, now that I'm thinking about it, that sounds horrific. I worry that there will be a lot more gasoline needed as well in these areas, because people are definitely going to need cars if they wanna get anywhere in time. The oil, the electricity, the water that would be needed even, just it doesn't sound like it would be beneficial to the planet or the people."

    {
      "question_number": "8",
      "question": "What economic effects, both positive and negative, might result from changing zoning laws to allow more multi-family housing?",
      "answer": "This I'm less versed in. I don't understand what specific effects might happen, but I can make a couple of guesses maybe. I assume that more local businesses might be able to open up, but the thing is, I don't think that they would be able to compete with monopolies like Walmart or Sam's Club. Things like that. I still do think that local businesses would be wiped out just as easily as they have been. So I can't see very many positives aside from more money going to corporations, which is not a positive in my opinion. I suppose maybe it might benefit something economically for the city, like tax-wise perhaps or something. I can't imagine what. I'm thinking very hard about this and it's taking me a while to think. I'm trying to think of positives. I suppose maybe more professionals would be able to afford living in the city and that could be a net positive and maybe that would have an economic effect, but I really can't think of many positives. I suppose maybe, like was said, rent might become lower, but even with that, property values would go down it would seem. I don't think there are very many positives. There are certainly more net negatives."

    {
      "question_number": "9",
      "question": "How do you think the interests of current residents versus future residents should be balanced when making zoning decisions?",
      "answer": "I think the interests of current residents are certainly the most important. We cannot predict the future. We are not time travelers. Sure, we have people who are professionals who can look at patterns and think about how it might go, but we don't know that for certain. We should worry about the people who are living here now and their futures, not potential people who might be here someday. Because once we start thinking in hypotheticals, people are going to start thinking in the way that benefits them, and powerful people, in other words, typically richer people, are going to have more of a say in the future of places. So I think that it would not benefit the people who are already living somewhere to think of future residents' best interests. I think that we should absolutely highlight and focus on the struggles of current residents and their interests and what they need, because adding a bunch of extra people to something that's not entirely functioning just is a recipe for disaster."

    {
      "question_number": "10",
      "question": "What role do you think social equity and access to opportunity play in discussions about zoning and housing policy?",
      "answer": "Here it certainly gets more complicated in that yes, definitely people who can't afford to live somewhere need a place that's low income to live. I just don't think that that should be upzoning. I think that yes, low income housing should be established for sure. It would be very helpful. However, doing that in places that already have an established pattern, that already have an established presence, is detrimental to those places and to those people. It's not going to work. However, of course social equity plays a big amount and of course people have a right to have a place to live. People have a right to shelter, a right to food, a right to water, a right to the internet, a right to electricity. And upzoning areas that are already existing will not do that for them. I don't think so. It'll make everything harder for everybody. When it comes to social equity, I think it has everything to do with it and I think everybody deserves equal opportunity, which they won't get if we just start adding low income housing to areas that are already pre-existing. Areas need to be dictated for that or given for that. Again, very ideally by local government to see what would work the best. Perhaps in expanding cities, for instance, where they can build new schools or bigger schools or focus on an area that can be improved."

      "question": "Would small changes in Higher density housing lead to noticeable changes in Support for Upzoning, or would it take larger shifts? Does it have a positive effect (increasing it) or a negative effect (decreasing it)? How strong is this effect?",
      "answer": "This question is a little confusing, so I need to take some time to talk through it and think about it. I think that larger shifts would be very detrimental to the population and the economy and just generally everything here. At least here in my city, I'm considering it from a bigger lens as best I can. I think that smaller changes would probably lead for more support or rather less negativity. I think that if things happened very fast, the negative changes would be very noticeable. Whereas if things happened in very little ways and slowly, perhaps the cities would be able to manage it better and the areas might be able to develop in time. And perhaps people won't realize things are getting worse if they do as quickly. Because people are able to turn a blind eye to things as long as they are doing okay a lot of the time. So it's like people might be blissfully ignorant if it's not affecting them. Whereas if there are these big things, then there will be a lot of people talking about it all at once very vocally and more people will be aware of it. So I think the less people that are aware, the less of an effect it will have generally."

      "answer": "Disruption to community has an extremely negative effect on support for upzoning. And I think it is very, very significant. I can't see anybody wanting things to change in that way. I understand that we do need areas for development, like choose specific areas for lower income housing, for new apartment buildings are affordable. But I can't see anybody wanting things to change like that. I can't see any of the neighborhoods nearby being able to function even remotely with that sort of change. I can't see any of the schools being able to handle it. All I can envision are angry parents with how the schools are going. I can consider angry older residents or distressed older residents with how much everything is changing. I can imagine shops dealing with new competition they haven't dealt with before, ones that are barely staying afloat compared to things like Walmart. I think that disruption is one of the biggest effects and probably the thing people would be the most against or feel the most strong about."

      "answer": "I think it's a significantly strong connection and something that we should think about. It definitely has a negative effect on how I would feel about upzoning because, for instance, my parents are in their late 60s to early 80s, like they are older. I can't see them being able to function that way. I can't see any of where the businesses they used to work at, I can't see that working. I understand that it's important for people to adapt, but I don't think people should have to adapt that significantly, especially in areas that are already established where people have owned homes for over 40, 50 years even. I don't think it's fair to shift things that significantly in established neighbourhoods, old local businesses that have somehow survived things like COVID and monopolies rising, corporations. It doesn't feel fair and it has a very strong effect on me and the way that I feel about it. I assume it would have a very strong effect on them and a very strong effect on their relatives, even relatives living elsewhere. Houses, even single family houses, are already crowded a lot of the time. It's a big family living in one house and the areas are crowded, the schools are crowded, the workplaces, it's already so hard to find a job. I can't see that many, I can't see it working. I can't see it being remotely beneficial for older people."

      "question": "What causes changes in Support for Upzoning? Are these influences strong or weak?",
      "answer": "think that I've been pretty clear on what causes changes in support. For instance, how fast it is, or how slow it is, or how quick, you know, just like how, how little or big the changes are, what, what's put in place to deal with it, how infrastructure changes, if we can work with transportation, that's like a limitless answer. And these influences are both strong and weak, depending, I think that this is all the questions that have already been answered before, basically, I can't like list them all over again."

      "answer": "It's definitely a strong effect. And in areas where most people rent, it would be very beneficial. But in areas where most people own their houses, it has a negative effect. So it really just depends. It's a very strong effect in either a really good or a really bad way, depending on where this happens. In areas where most people rent, yes, upzoning would be great. It would make rent less for those people. And again, maybe it'll make property tax less in other areas, like family-owned houses, things like that. But it would also decrease the value of their property. So yeah, affordability kind of has everything to do with it. I think the biggest benefit would be being able to, for poorer people, for people of lower income, to afford a place to live. That's what's necessary. But we can't do it at the detriment of other people who are already established, because it would just lead to so many problems for everybody, including the low-income people moving in. It's unfortunate."

There's already an energy to it if that makes sense there's already something that people are used to and Change is not something very many people can adapt to very easily like yes We can adapt eventually, but is it something easy to adapt to absolutely not I? Think it would have a rather negative effect I can't see how adding an apartment complex for instance to an Area where there are pretty much just single-family houses Wouldn't not be totally out of place and have this sort of like new Congestion of traffic and new things opening up and everything changing I think the biggest issue is change and that does have a negative effect on things"

      "answer": "Oh, the effect of public transportation is absolutely immediate. It would be terrible. It absolutely takes time to develop a transportation system that works for adding so many new people to an area, especially if the point is to give lower income people a way to exist, a way to thrive. How would they do that without efficient public transportation? It would have an extremely negative effect because either they're going to have to figure out how to get a car. They're going to have to figure out a way to walk to where they need to be for work. They're going to have to figure out a way to walk to school because even the school bus system is out of whack in the area. There's going to have to be so much more. It's going to take so long to develop this. If it were to happen immediately, there would be absolutely no hope. It has an extremely negative impact unless the city already has an established and efficient public transportation system."

      "answer": "I mean, a lot of people are blind to environmental concerns to begin with, while it's very important to me, I think it would be the last thing on everybody else's mind for most people's minds. I'm not generalizing here. I think it would be the last thing on people's mind, unfortunately. I would say it has a negative effect. I can't see it having a positive effect of any kind. It's not like more people has ever led to the environment becoming better in human history. To environmentalists, it would certainly decrease support. To general people, I don't think it would have an effect at all. So depending on the person and their morals and how much they care about ethicality and environmental protection, it either is a very strong effect in the negative sense, or for unfortunately, probably the majority or at least a very fair amount of people, it's not going to be something that they think about compared to all the other problems."

I would have the same answer as I did to the last question because to me these two answers are tied in. Natural gases are something that we expend and that we are eventually going to run out of and that's always been the case and people don't think about it or consider it. So yes, I think same answer. Depending on how environmentally ethical you are, it either has a strong negative effect or other people won't even think about it."

I'm just saying in regards to monopolies that corporations like Walmart, Sam's, things that have already monopolized the industry, they exist and they're already rooting out small businesses. So I don't see how people coming in and opening up new small locally owned businesses would be beneficial to themselves because they might easily be like purged out or like culled by the big corporations in every city or they would just potentially become competition to the already existing and already struggling locally owned businesses that are here. That's what I meant by monopolies."

      "answer": "I mean I feel like if current residents had less things to strive for or hope for or changes that they would need then perhaps it would be easier to accept upzoning. I think that's what I meant by that current residents interest is solving the current issues is necessary before we add more people to an area that's already dysfunctional or a city that's already dysfunctional. Things needs to be in a stable place before adding even more instability to it. So I would say it has a pretty strong effect because content people are more likely to accept change than people who are already having a hard time or are already angry about something."

They have a right to survive, a right to electricity, a right to warmth, a right to the internet these days with the way things work. Everyone has their basic human rights. And of course, giving people a place to live is important. I would say that would have a positive effect on the idea of upzoning because it's the only big benefit that I could see and I'm sure a lot of people could see is it would give people who can't afford a place to live and make affording to live easier for people who are struggling. So it's a very strong effect. It's the one big positive that exists in all this."

I mean, I feel like as long as areas where, if already pre-established areas where lots of people who have been living here for a long time live remain untouched, that might lead to more support. But if negative changes happen to them, if things change in their lives and there's more chaos and change added to it, then that would be a negative effect. And it would be pretty strong either way.

So it's very hard already to deal with how many kids are in so many schools that already exist here. Adding even more to a certain area would totally overflow the school system. Like there would be no way to give attention to the kids who need it. There would be no way to have enough teachers. The classes are already so big, the sizes of the classes, I mean. And it would be immediate, especially if many people move in all at once. It would be a very negative effect. And I would say it's pretty strong. And this would be detrimental to both angry parents and kids who are not getting a proper education to begin with. It's such a poor school system already.

      "answer": "I don't really understand this question either. The main cause of single-family neighborhoods are just that they were already pre-established to begin with. In the past, homes used to be affordable, so it made sense to live the typical quote-unquote American dream and get your white picket fence little home with a single earner earning all the income for a family and being able to support a family of four on just one income. That's not possible anymore. So I would say that the cause of single-family neighborhoods is a time before everything was as ridiculously priced as it is now. It's not feasible anymore, but it used to be at least somewhat feasible in the past. Now it's basically impossible to be able to do that. So the cause of it is just it's pre-established. It already existed decades and decades ago. I would say that these influences just are. I don't think it's a positive or negative influence on cities. I think that it's nice to have areas like that. It's certainly incredibly expensive to live there, and rent is impossible to afford there, but I don't think that adding to those neighborhoods something that will decrease them in value is beneficial to anybody.

      "question": "To what extent do you support or oppose upzoning policies that allow for higher density housing in traditionally single-family neighborhoods? Please explain your reasoning.",
      "answer": "I honestly think it's not a bad idea. I think it can be helpful for certain communities especially let's say if your rent is higher. I honestly think if there's more density to a neighborhood it could lower your rent or have a better community for you and your family."
    },
    {
      "question_number": "3",
      "question": "How do you think upzoning policies might affect housing affordability in urban areas?",
      "answer": "I think it can affect just the overall landscaping section of the neighborhoods because I think if you have a certain amount of people in a neighborhood or let's say, for example, if you have more than enough people in the neighborhood, it can definitely raise the prices because there's a lot more resources to be made out there."
    },
    {
      "question_number": "4",
      "question": "What impact do you believe increased housing density might have on neighborhood character and quality of life?",
      "answer": "Overall, I think what increases the housing density the most would just be the people in general, and the housing that gets built and then I also think, just like I said in the previous paragraph, that, you know, like the resources now will be a lot more and you have to use a lot more resources, especially with a bunch more people in your neighborhood. I also believe that once there's a certain amount of people that's in your neighborhood, well then you have to look at the, like your sewer systems and your plumbing systems and see how much more you have to spend, because you're gonna have to either have a septic system in place or you're gonna have to figure out what kind of community sewer system you're going to be running through."
    },
    {
      "question_number": "5",
      "question": "How do you think upzoning might affect transportation systems and traffic congestion in cities?",
      "answer": "Again, I think it will affect the traffic congestion in cities just because about the more people there, which means there's gonna be more cars and more jobs. So there's gonna be a lot more roads that are gonna be more busy."
    },
    {
      "question_number": "6",
      "question": "What role do you believe local government should play in regulating housing development and density?",
      "answer": "I think the role that the government should probably play would be to have the housing probably spaced out and in a certain way where you're not congested and having a bunch of lines or like a bunch of just Crowded people"
    },
    {
      "question_number": "7",
      "question": "How might environmental concerns factor into decisions about urban density and zoning?",
      "answer": "So the environmental concerns that I would say would be definitely the water system and if I would also say the plants and trees I would think that there's gonna be a lot more trees planted and more seeds planted because there's more people which means more houses which means more cars which means more carbon emissions so I kind of think it all lines up to to be more of a concern in the environment just for the fact of nature."
    },
    {
      "question_number": "8",
      "question": "What economic effects, both positive and negative, might result from changing zoning laws to allow more multi-family housing?",
      "answer": "the like the so the economic effects would definitely be that the positive side would be more people which means more community and also means more job opportunities which means like more money would be flown in to your neighborhood which can make a better community but then on the negative side I mean like I said in the previous paragraphs it'd be crowded you would have a lot more cars on the streets you'd be like it'd be a lot more loud probably as well in your neighborhood and I also believe there'd be a lot more carbon emissions more carbon footprints as well"

      "question_number": "9",
      "question": "How do you think the interests of current residents versus future residents should be balanced when making zoning decisions?",
      "answer": "I believe for your current residence there should be a zone where where you have a specific amount of stuff for you and your family that's already put in place and then for future for future people I Kind of think that they need to build their own environments Kind of as well with their family, and I kind of think That they'd have to start from scratch instead of the current residence"

    {
      "question_number": "10",
      "question": "What role do you think social equity and access to opportunity play in discussions about zoning and housing policy?",
      "answer": "Well, I do believe that the social, like the social aspect of this would definitely be how safe is it and if there's good hardworking people or there's bad people, I kind of think that all depends and then like the opportunity as well would just, you know, just be more job opportunities. But again, I kind of think the social part would just be if you have good, solid people or bad people in your neighborhood."

      "answer": "I definitely think it will have a positive effect, just for the fact like I've stated before, you know, like there'd be more job opportunities, there'd be more stuff just running around your neighborhood like more stuff being built more trees being planted, and just a better community overall. So, like I kind of think that that would be a pretty strong effect."

      "question_number": "12",
      "question": "What might lead to increases or decreases in Support for Upzoning, and how significant are these effects? Please also indicate if these influences are positive (increasing) or negative (decreasing).",
      "answer": "I think what would lead to increases in support would be the overall environment and the money that we bring into the community and to build an overall better community. But again, I kind of think the decreasing effect would definitely be if the people that are moving into the neighborhood are good people or bad people."

      "answer": "Again, it all depends, um, you know, I mean, just like I said before, it kind of depends on the people themselves. Like for example, if the people that are moving into your neighborhood are good, solid people that that have jobs and have a good life, then yes, it'd be a positive effect. But if the people that are moving into your neighborhood are quote unquote ghetto or like quote unquote, not good people, then it'd have a negative effect and, and the strength of that effect would matter on the people."

      "answer": "Yes, I do believe small changes would lead to noticeable changes. For example, if that population is a good, hard-working population, then it could be good for your community, meaning more trees planted, more jobs to do, more cars on the road, more houses to be built. But then it also could lead to a negative effect, meaning the people could steal, the people could try to break into your cars and take all your belongings."

      "question": "How confident are you that changes in People lead to changes in Support for Upzoning? Does it have a positive effect (increasing it) or a negative effect (decreasing it)? How strong is this effect?",
      "answer": "I'm pretty confident. I do think that people can lead to changes and support, and I do think it would have a positive effect. The strength of the effect would probably be pretty minimal, but it could also be pretty big if the people themselves are working pretty hard."

      "answer": "It honestly all depends on the situation. I do believe that traffic congestion could be pretty viable. But then I also think it can take time to develop if people don't have jobs right away. But then I do think would be a negative effect just for the fact that like it'd be a lot more louder on the roads. And then I also believe that like it take you a pretty good amount of time to get to work at that point."

      "answer": "So for the population increase, I'd definitely say it'd be pretty immediate just for the fact that the people are present and they'd already be in their houses by then. Again, I personally think it'd be a positive effect because your community will definitely be bigger and stronger. There'd be more job opportunities and there'd be more stuff to do around your neighborhood environment. The strength of that effect would probably be pretty immediate."

But I mean, I do think it'd have a pretty negative effect just for the fact that our world is kind of in a climate change crisis. So I do believe that the strength of that effect would be pretty high."

For example, if that population is a good, hard-working population, then it could be good for your community, meaning more trees planted, more jobs to do, more cars on the road, more houses to be built.

There'd be more job opportunities and there'd be more stuff to do around your neighborhood environment. The strength of that effect would probably be pretty immediate."

For example, if that population is a good, hard-working population, then it could be good for your community, meaning more trees planted, more jobs to do, more cars on the road, more houses to be built. But then it also could lead to a negative effect, meaning the people could steal, the people could try to break into your cars and take all your belongings."

I also believe that once there's a certain amount of people that's in your neighborhood, well then you have to look at the, like your sewer systems and your plumbing systems and see how much more you have to spend, because you're gonna have to either have a septic system in place or you're gonna have to figure out what kind of community sewer system you're going to be running through."

      "answer": "I honestly think it's not a bad idea. I think it can be helpful for certain communities especially let's say if your rent is higher. I honestly think if there's more density to a neighborhood it could lower your rent or have a better community for you and your family."

      "question_number": "2",
      "question": "What do you think are the most significant impacts, positive or negative, of increasing housing density in residential neighborhoods?",

    {
      "question_number": "3",
      "question": "How do you think upzoning policies might affect housing affordability in urban areas?",
      "answer": "I think it can affect just the overall landscaping section of the neighborhoods because I think if you have a certain amount of people in a neighborhood or let's say, for example, if you have more than enough people in the neighborhood, it can definitely raise the prices because there's a lot more resources to be made out there."

      "question_number": "4",
      "question": "What impact do you believe increased housing density might have on neighborhood character and quality of life?",
      "answer": "Overall, I think what increases the housing density the most would just be the people in general, and the housing that gets built and then I also think, just like I said in the previous paragraph, that, you know, like the resources now will be a lot more and you have to use a lot more resources, especially with a bunch more people in your neighborhood. I also believe that once there's a certain amount of people that's in your neighborhood, well then you have to look at the, like your sewer systems and your plumbing systems and see how much more you have to spend, because you're gonna have to either have a septic system in place or you're gonna have to figure out what kind of community sewer system you're going to be running through."

      "question": "How do you think upzoning might affect transportation systems and traffic congestion in cities?",
      "answer": "Again, I think it will affect the traffic congestion in cities just because about the more people there, which means there's gonna be more cars and more jobs. So there's gonna be a lot more roads that are gonna be more busy."

      "question_number": "6",
      "question": "What role do you believe local government should play in regulating housing development and density?",

      "answer": "So the environmental concerns that I would say would be definitely the water system and if I would also say the plants and trees I would think that there's gonna be a lot more trees planted and more seeds planted because there's more people which means more houses which means more cars which means more carbon emissions so I kind of think it all lines up to to be more of a concern in the environment just for the fact of nature."

      "answer": "Well, I do believe that the social, like the social aspect of this would definitely be how safe is it and if there's good hardworking people or there's bad people, I kind of think that all depends and then like the opportunity as well would just, you know, just be more job opportunities. But again, I kind of think the social part would just be if you have good, solid people or bad people in your neighborhood."

So, like I kind of think that that would be a pretty strong effect."

      "answer": "I think what would lead to increases in support would be the overall environment and the money that we bring into the community and to build an overall better community. But again, I kind of think the decreasing effect would definitely be if the people that are moving into the neighborhood are good people or bad people."

      "answer": "Again, it all depends, um, you know, I mean, just like I said before, it kind of depends on the people themselves. Like for example, if the people that are moving into your neighborhood are good, solid people that that have jobs and have a good life, then yes, it'd be a positive effect. But if the people that are moving into your neighborhood are quote unquote ghetto or like quote unquote, not good people, then it'd have a negative effect and, and the strength of that effect would matter on the people."

      "answer": "Yes, I do believe small changes would lead to noticeable changes. For example, if that population is a good, hard-working population, then it could be good for your community, meaning more trees planted, more jobs to do, more cars on the road, more houses to be built. But then it also could lead to a negative effect, meaning the people could steal, the people could try to break into your cars and take all your belongings."

      "answer": "It honestly all depends on the situation. I do believe that traffic congestion could be pretty viable. But then I also think it can take time to develop if people don't have jobs right away. But then I do think would be a negative effect just for the fact that like it'd be a lot more louder on the roads.

Again, I personally think it'd be a positive effect because your community will definitely be bigger and stronger. There'd be more job opportunities and there'd be more stuff to do around your neighborhood environment. The strength of that effect would probably be pretty immediate."

I also believe that once there's a certain amount of people that's in your neighborhood, well then you have to look at the, like your sewer systems and your plumbing systems and see how much more you have to spend, because you're gonna have to either have a septic system in place or you're gonna have to figure out what kind of community sewer system you're going to be running through."

So, like I kind of think that that would be a pretty strong effect."

      "answer": "I think what would lead to increases in support would be the overall environment and the money that we bring into the community and to build an overall better community.

Like for example, if the people that are moving into your neighborhood are good, solid people that that have jobs and have a good life, then yes, it'd be a positive effect. But if the people that are moving into your neighborhood are quote unquote ghetto or like quote unquote, not good people, then it'd have a negative effect and, and the strength of that effect would matter on the people."

      "answer": "Yes, I do believe small changes would lead to noticeable changes. For example, if that population is a good, hard-working population, then it could be good for your community, meaning more trees planted, more jobs to do, more cars on the road, more houses to be built. But then it also could lead to a negative effect, meaning the people could steal, the people could try to break into your cars and take all your belongings."

      "answer": "I'm pretty confident. I do think that people can lead to changes and support, and I do think it would have a positive effect. The strength of the effect would probably be pretty minimal, but it could also be pretty big if the people themselves are working pretty hard."

      "answer": "It honestly all depends on the situation. I do believe that traffic congestion could be pretty viable. But then I also think it can take time to develop if people don't have jobs right away. But then I do think would be a negative effect just for the fact that like it'd be a lot more louder on the roads. And then I also believe that like it take you a pretty good amount of time to get to work at that point."

      "answer": "So for the population increase, I'd definitely say it'd be pretty immediate just for the fact that the people are present and they'd already be in their houses by then. Again, I personally think it'd be a positive effect because your community will definitely be bigger and stronger. There'd be more job opportunities and there'd be more stuff to do around your neighborhood environment. The strength of that effect would probably be pretty immediate."

But I mean, I do think it'd have a pretty negative effect just for the fact that our world is kind of in a climate change crisis.

You could make the support for upzoning increase exponentially by very much so lowering the property taxes that we are all currently paying in this county.

The reason I say that is because they have built a crap ton of apartment complexes in my county over the past few years, but home prices and apartment rentals have all gone up and property taxes have continued to go up.

Then the stuff gets built, more people come, there's more traffic, but our property taxes have gone up every single year regardless of all this.

So I think it's a load of crap when people pretend that this somehow eases the burden for people who can't find homes. It's not that people can't find homes.

You could make the support for upzoning increase exponentially by very much so lowering the property taxes that we are all currently paying in this county.

We all drive So you put a thousand people into an up zoned building and now there's a thousand cars so that just Brings down quality of life Character.

Then the stuff gets built, more people come, there's more traffic, but our property taxes have gone up every single year regardless of all this. You're taking in tons more property taxes from all those housing developments you've built. Why is my single-family home taxes going up every year? It's BS."

They're not building government housing or anything like that. These places are like luxury, luxury apartments. They cost more than my house to live in. So I think it's a load of crap when people pretend that this somehow eases the burden for people who can't find homes. It's not that people can't find homes. It's that people aren't paid enough to afford them anymore and inflation has made it even harder. Pay people more and don't inflate the cost of everything. My house price has doubled in seven years.

Does this potentially bring a de-beautification of the roadsides? All these cars, are they throwing out trash? Did we hire more people to help clean up that trash? That sort of thing.

You could make the support for upzoning increase exponentially by very much so lowering the property taxes that we are all currently paying in this county. I've mentioned before ours are almost the highest in Georgia, if not the highest, and they go up every year. The influence would be positive if you brought down costs."

I feel like there must be kickbacks or something because our local government completely ignores everyone who lives here, every one of our voices. They completely tune us out and they just approve everything. Tons of gas stations, tons of liquor stores, tons of apartment complexes that literally none of us want.

They are inverse of each other. Make it affordable, somehow decrease traffic, and you would increase public support. But that's not what they're doing. It's going to remain negative."

      "answer": "I think the effect is pretty immediate. You know, you build 10 apartment complexes, each one holds 200 apartments, and bam, that's all in a three-mile area. Now guess what? People are living there and driving from there. They're all on the roads with us and they weren't here a year ago. That's definitely going to have a negative effect on support. Population density is an issue."

      "answer": "Strong connection. For sure our property taxes are crazy high. They are building all this crap and our property taxes still go up every year. They haven't lowered them at all even though they're bringing in millions more with all the housing that they've built and filled. It's really not fair and they do nothing about it even though we all do use our voice."

      "answer": "It seems to make no difference. We used to have tiny town hall participation, if they even held town halls. Over the last five years, participation in town halls and hearings has exploded because of social media. We organize, we plan, we voice our concerns and we come prepared in absolute opposition to the continuously saying yes to every single apartment complex and up zone. I don't know what it would take. We have voted certain people out and they continue to say yes and put their hand out. I don't know how you stop that. It's a pretty strong effect and problem."

      "answer": "I think obviously luxury apartments are more desirable to look at and have in your community than cheaper apartments or builder grade everything or government housing. I don't think any of these have a positive effect. None of these things are wanted where I live. So I'm not I'm not really sure how you would improve on that when people don't want this. We prefer single-family homes. I don't know why we can't build normal starter single-family homes like we used to back when boomers were buying homes. Why does everything have to be crammed all together?"

      "answer": "I don't think anyone believes this is going to make housing more affordable. This is just a lie they tell us to get this stuff passed and pushed through. The reason I say that is because they have built a crap ton of apartment complexes in my county over the past few years, but home prices and apartment rentals have all gone up and property taxes have continued to go up. So they're saying that it's going to affect the affordability of homes in a positive way is not truthful. No one trusts it and it's not going to build support because we know we're being lied to."

      "answer": "Immediate effects, if they're positive, probably increase support for upzoning. But overall, I just think it's a negative. It's not something that the suburbs wanted. We don't live in a giant city. We didn't want our suburbs to become that way. So it's a negative effect overall, regardless of how they spin it."

      "question": "What do you think are the main causes of Upzoning policies, and how certain are you about these relationships? Please also indicate if these influences are positive (increasing) or negative (decreasing).",
      "answer": "I think the main causes are money. They must get a lot of money for the city when they pass this stuff and let these things be built. I don't know what the transparency is on that. I've not looked it up, but I assume there must be a positive for government officials who say yes to this stuff or they wouldn't say yes to everything. Like they live in these communities too. They can drive the streets and see that it's not desirable to have this stuff, so I'm not really sure why all the yes. I'm not sure what is the main cause if not money or gain in some way."

      "question": "How confident are you that changes in Negative effect lead to changes in Support for Upzoning? Does it have a positive effect (increasing it) or a negative effect (decreasing it)? How strong is this effect?",
      "answer": "Negative effects absolutely lead to less support for upzoning. I'm very confident in that. You know, more traffic, that's a negative. Lessened support. More trash on the roads, potentially more crime. Schools are now too full and so your kid has to go to class in an un-air-conditioned trailer because their school can't hold the number of new, the number of students who've come since we've built all this. Negative effects definitely decrease support. Positive effects would increase support."

      "answer": "Population density is definitely an issue. I don't see how packing even more people into a smaller area with up zoning is going to help that problem. So I don't really understand why they word it that way. It's not, you know, these people don't live here now. You're building all this stuff to bring them here. I think there's other ways that we could deal with population density and the lack of affordable housing. There's other ways to do this besides this model."

People are living there and driving from there. They're all on the roads with us and they weren't here a year ago. That's definitely going to have a negative effect on support.

Over the last five years, participation in town halls and hearings has exploded because of social media. We organize, we plan, we voice our concerns and we come prepared in absolute opposition to the continuously saying yes to every single apartment complex and up zone. I don't know what it would take. We have voted certain people out and they continue to say yes and put their hand out. I don't know how you stop that. It's a pretty strong effect and problem."

I don't think any of these have a positive effect. None of these things are wanted where I live. So I'm not I'm not really sure how you would improve on that when people don't want this.

      "answer": "I don't think anyone believes this is going to make housing more affordable. This is just a lie they tell us to get this stuff passed and pushed through. The reason I say that is because they have built a crap ton of apartment complexes in my county over the past few years, but home prices and apartment rentals have all gone up and property taxes have continued to go up.

I've not looked it up, but I assume there must be a positive for government officials who say yes to this stuff or they wouldn't say yes to everything. Like they live in these communities too.

More trash on the roads, potentially more crime. Schools are now too full and so your kid has to go to class in an un-air-conditioned trailer because their school can't hold the number of new, the number of students who've come since we've built all this.

So I don't really understand why they word it that way. It's not, you know, these people don't live here now. You're building all this stuff to bring them here.

It pisses me off when you have tons of us showing up at these town halls, showing up at these hearings, and we're all together saying no please, and they completely ignore us and pass this crap anyway. Then the stuff gets built, more people come, there's more traffic, but our property taxes have gone up every single year regardless of all this.

They're not building government housing or anything like that. These places are like luxury, luxury apartments. They cost more than my house to live in. So I think it's a load of crap when people pretend that this somehow eases the burden for people who can't find homes. It's not that people can't find homes. It's that people aren't paid enough to afford them anymore and inflation has made it even harder. Pay people more and don't inflate the cost of everything. My house price has doubled in seven years.

Does this potentially bring a de-beautification of the roadsides? All these cars, are they throwing out trash? Did we hire more people to help clean up that trash? That sort of thing.

      "answer": "You could increase support for upzoning by actually making these houses super affordable, obviously. You could make the support for upzoning increase exponentially by very much so lowering the property taxes that we are all currently paying in this county. I've mentioned before ours are almost the highest in Georgia, if not the highest, and they go up every year. The influence would be positive if you brought down costs."

      "answer": "Yeah, if you advertise, hey, you know, one-bedroom apartments cost $1,800, these new up-zoned buildings are going to cost $1,000 a month, you would have a ton of support for that right away from people who are struggling to afford to live, which is probably over half the country.

They are building tons of apartment complexes, and they are now starting to upzone, like our Costco is upzoning. The effect on traffic congestion is extremely significant. It definitely decreases support for upzoning, I think, for obvious reasons. One of the main reasons."

I feel like there must be kickbacks or something because our local government completely ignores everyone who lives here, every one of our voices. They completely tune us out and they just approve everything. Tons of gas stations, tons of liquor stores, tons of apartment complexes that literally none of us want.

      "answer": "I don't know. They always say it could reduce costs, but even one-bedroom apartments where I live cost $1,800, which is what my mortgage is, so I don't see just them building upward isn't going to make it cheaper. It'll probably cost just as much, but just triple our traffic."

      "answer": "Quality of life will go down because everybody is out and I don't live in a walkable city. We all drive So you put a thousand people into an up zoned building and now there's a thousand cars so that just Brings down quality of life Character. Yeah, I mean it's kind of an eyesore, but they could build really nice quality luxury ones, I suppose"

      "answer": "My county and my city don't have any transportation systems. There are no buses, no nothing, so traffic congestion is already pretty bad and you add more of these up zonings, which they're doing, and it's already made a negative impact and how long it takes to get somewhere and we all have to drive."

      "answer": "I believe local and federal should have a say in this. You shouldn't just be allowed to say yes to all of this when everyone who lives here says no and we already have some of the highest property taxes in our state of Georgia. So I feel like our government should listen to us and do their job."

They're trying to build a gigantic data center in the city next to me, same county, and they had a bajillion people show up and fight this over and over again and it's still being approved. Yeah, environmental concerns definitely factor in, but anyone who puts their hand out to collect money for this deal is going to say yes."

      "answer": "For business owners, it's probably good for them because more people in the same small area, the more chances you have of people visiting your restaurant or your store. So from that aspect, it's good for business owners. It's just not good for the people who actually live here, work here, drive here."

It pisses me off when you have tons of us showing up at these town halls, showing up at these hearings, and we're all together saying no please, and they completely ignore us and pass this crap anyway. Then the stuff gets built, more people come, there's more traffic, but our property taxes have gone up every single year regardless of all this. You're taking in tons more property taxes from all those housing developments you've built. Why is my single-family home taxes going up every year? It's BS."

      "answer": "I think this is a tool that people who make money off of building this crap pretends that it helps with equity and access. It absolutely does not. They're not building government housing or anything like that. These places are like luxury, luxury apartments. They cost more than my house to live in. So I think it's a load of crap when people pretend that this somehow eases the burden for people who can't find homes. It's not that people can't find homes. It's that people aren't paid enough to afford them anymore and inflation has made it even harder. Pay people more and don't inflate the cost of everything. My house price has doubled in seven years. That's ridiculous."

Does this potentially bring a de-beautification of the roadsides? All these cars, are they throwing out trash? Did we hire more people to help clean up that trash? That sort of thing.

      "answer": "You could increase support for upzoning by actually making these houses super affordable, obviously. You could make the support for upzoning increase exponentially by very much so lowering the property taxes that we are all currently paying in this county. I've mentioned before ours are almost the highest in Georgia, if not the highest, and they go up every year. The influence would be positive if you brought down costs."

      "answer": "Yeah, if you advertise, hey, you know, one-bedroom apartments cost $1,800, these new up-zoned buildings are going to cost $1,000 a month, you would have a ton of support for that right away from people who are struggling to afford to live, which is probably over half the country.

      "answer": "Where I live, traffic congestion was already a big problem. It has become a massive problem over the last seven years. They are building tons of apartment complexes, and they are now starting to upzone, like our Costco is upzoning. The effect on traffic congestion is extremely significant. It definitely decreases support for upzoning, I think, for obvious reasons. One of the main reasons."

      "answer": "Well, the public are the ones who have to live with these upzoning changes. So if you don't have public support for upzoning, you're going to have public opposition. They are inverse of each other. Make it affordable, somehow decrease traffic, and you would increase public support. But that's not what they're doing. It's going to remain negative."

People are living there and driving from there. They're all on the roads with us and they weren't here a year ago. That's definitely going to have a negative effect on support.

      "answer": "Strong connection. For sure our property taxes are crazy high. They are building all this crap and our property taxes still go up every year. They haven't lowered them at all even though they're bringing in millions more with all the housing that they've built and filled.

      "answer": "It seems to make no difference. We used to have tiny town hall participation, if they even held town halls. Over the last five years, participation in town halls and hearings has exploded because of social media. We organize, we plan, we voice our concerns and we come prepared in absolute opposition to the continuously saying yes to every single apartment complex and up zone. I don't know what it would take. We have voted certain people out and they continue to say yes and put their hand out. I don't know how you stop that. It's a pretty strong effect and problem."

      "answer": "I think obviously luxury apartments are more desirable to look at and have in your community than cheaper apartments or builder grade everything or government housing. I don't think any of these have a positive effect. None of these things are wanted where I live. So I'm not I'm not really sure how you would improve on that when people don't want this. We prefer single-family homes. I don't know why we can't build normal starter single-family homes like we used to back when boomers were buying homes. Why does everything have to be crammed all together?"

      "answer": "I don't think anyone believes this is going to make housing more affordable. This is just a lie they tell us to get this stuff passed and pushed through. The reason I say that is because they have built a crap ton of apartment complexes in my county over the past few years, but home prices and apartment rentals have all gone up and property taxes have continued to go up. So they're saying that it's going to affect the affordability of homes in a positive way is not truthful. No one trusts it and it's not going to build support because we know we're being lied to."

      "answer": "Immediate effects, if they're positive, probably increase support for upzoning. But overall, I just think it's a negative. It's not something that the suburbs wanted. We don't live in a giant city. We didn't want our suburbs to become that way. So it's a negative effect overall, regardless of how they spin it."

      "question": "What do you think are the main causes of Upzoning policies, and how certain are you about these relationships? Please also indicate if these influences are positive (increasing) or negative (decreasing).",
      "answer": "I think the main causes are money. They must get a lot of money for the city when they pass this stuff and let these things be built. I don't know what the transparency is on that. I've not looked it up, but I assume there must be a positive for government officials who say yes to this stuff or they wouldn't say yes to everything. Like they live in these communities too. They can drive the streets and see that it's not desirable to have this stuff, so I'm not really sure why all the yes. I'm not sure what is the main cause if not money or gain in some way."

      "question": "How confident are you that changes in Negative effect lead to changes in Support for Upzoning? Does it have a positive effect (increasing it) or a negative effect (decreasing it)? How strong is this effect?",
      "answer": "Negative effects absolutely lead to less support for upzoning. I'm very confident in that. You know, more traffic, that's a negative. Lessened support. More trash on the roads, potentially more crime. Schools are now too full and so your kid has to go to class in an un-air-conditioned trailer because their school can't hold the number of new, the number of students who've come since we've built all this. Negative effects definitely decrease support. Positive effects would increase support."

      "answer": "Population density is definitely an issue. I don't see how packing even more people into a smaller area with up zoning is going to help that problem. So I don't really understand why they word it that way. It's not, you know, these people don't live here now. You're building all this stuff to bring them here. I think there's other ways that we could deal with population density and the lack of affordable housing. There's other ways to do this besides this model."

I don't think any of these have a positive effect. None of these things are wanted where I live. So I'm not I'm not really sure how you would improve on that when people don't want this.

The reason I say that is because they have built a crap ton of apartment complexes in my county over the past few years, but home prices and apartment rentals have all gone up and property taxes have continued to go up.

More trash on the roads, potentially more crime.

Then the stuff gets built, more people come, there's more traffic, but our property taxes have gone up every single year regardless of all this.

They're not building government housing or anything like that. These places are like luxury, luxury apartments. They cost more than my house to live in. So I think it's a load of crap when people pretend that this somehow eases the burden for people who can't find homes. It's not that people can't find homes. It's that people aren't paid enough to afford them anymore and inflation has made it even harder. Pay people more and don't inflate the cost of everything. My house price has doubled in seven years.

Does this potentially bring a de-beautification of the roadsides? All these cars, are they throwing out trash? Did we hire more people to help clean up that trash? That sort of thing.

You could make the support for upzoning increase exponentially by very much so lowering the property taxes that we are all currently paying in this county.

They are building tons of apartment complexes, and they are now starting to upzone, like our Costco is upzoning. The effect on traffic congestion is extremely significant.

I feel like there must be kickbacks or something because our local government completely ignores everyone who lives here, every one of our voices.

Then the stuff gets built, more people come, there's more traffic, but our property taxes have gone up every single year regardless of all this. You're taking in tons more property taxes from all those housing developments you've built. Why is my single-family home taxes going up every year? It's BS."

They're not building government housing or anything like that. These places are like luxury, luxury apartments. They cost more than my house to live in. So I think it's a load of crap when people pretend that this somehow eases the burden for people who can't find homes. It's not that people can't find homes. It's that people aren't paid enough to afford them anymore and inflation has made it even harder. Pay people more and don't inflate the cost of everything. My house price has doubled in seven years.

You could make the support for upzoning increase exponentially by very much so lowering the property taxes that we are all currently paying in this county.

They are building tons of apartment complexes, and they are now starting to upzone, like our Costco is upzoning. The effect on traffic congestion is extremely significant.

Over the last five years, participation in town halls and hearings has exploded because of social media. We organize, we plan, we voice our concerns and we come prepared in absolute opposition to the continuously saying yes to every single apartment complex and up zone. I don't know what it would take.

I don't think any of these have a positive effect. None of these things are wanted where I live. So I'm not I'm not really sure how you would improve on that when people don't want this. We prefer single-family homes. I don't know why we can't build normal starter single-family homes like we used to back when boomers were buying homes.

      "answer": "I don't think anyone believes this is going to make housing more affordable. This is just a lie they tell us to get this stuff passed and pushed through. The reason I say that is because they have built a crap ton of apartment complexes in my county over the past few years, but home prices and apartment rentals have all gone up and property taxes have continued to go up. So they're saying that it's going to affect the affordability of homes in a positive way is not truthful. No one trusts it and it's not going to build support because we know we're being lied to."

We don't live in a giant city. We didn't want our suburbs to become that way. So it's a negative effect overall, regardless of how they spin it."

I've not looked it up, but I assume there must be a positive for government officials who say yes to this stuff or they wouldn't say yes to everything. Like they live in these communities too. They can drive the streets and see that it's not desirable to have this stuff, so I'm not really sure why all the yes. I'm not sure what is the main cause if not money or gain in some way."

      "answer": "Negative effects absolutely lead to less support for upzoning. I'm very confident in that. You know, more traffic, that's a negative. Lessened support. More trash on the roads, potentially more crime. Schools are now too full and so your kid has to go to class in an un-air-conditioned trailer because their school can't hold the number of new, the number of students who've come since we've built all this.

So I don't really understand why they word it that way. It's not, you know, these people don't live here now. You're building all this stuff to bring them here. I think there's other ways that we could deal with population density and the lack of affordable housing. There's other ways to do this besides this model."

We don't live in a giant city. We didn't want our suburbs to become that way. So it's a negative effect overall, regardless of how they spin it."

      "answer": "I think the main causes are money. They must get a lot of money for the city when they pass this stuff and let these things be built. I don't know what the transparency is on that. I've not looked it up, but I assume there must be a positive for government officials who say yes to this stuff or they wouldn't say yes to everything. Like they live in these communities too. They can drive the streets and see that it's not desirable to have this stuff, so I'm not really sure why all the yes. I'm not sure what is the main cause if not money or gain in some way."

      "answer": "Negative effects absolutely lead to less support for upzoning. I'm very confident in that. You know, more traffic, that's a negative. Lessened support. More trash on the roads, potentially more crime. Schools are now too full and so your kid has to go to class in an un-air-conditioned trailer because their school can't hold the number of new, the number of students who've come since we've built all this. Negative effects definitely decrease support. Positive effects would increase support."

      "answer": "Population density is definitely an issue. I don't see how packing even more people into a smaller area with up zoning is going to help that problem. So I don't really understand why they word it that way. It's not, you know, these people don't live here now. You're building all this stuff to bring them here. I think there's other ways that we could deal with population density and the lack of affordable housing. There's other ways to do this besides this model."

I don't think any of these have a positive effect. None of these things are wanted where I live. So I'm not I'm not really sure how you would improve on that when people don't want this. We prefer single-family homes. I don't know why we can't build normal starter single-family homes like we used to back when boomers were buying homes. Why does everything have to be crammed all together?"

I don't know how good it would be for the people, I guess it would be called realtors or something. I don't know if there would be many positives for them, but definitely positives for the people renting the spaces. But for the landlord people, I think it would help them to make more money if they can gather a lot of people and just have them all in one space and they're all paying like they're supposed to.

For example, if there's a lot of crime going on or like a lot of noise, that could decrease the support for it.

      "answer": "As I'm reading this description, I don't really see a connection between the two things. If there is one, it's not obvious to me."

      "answer": "I think with pollution it would have a negative effect. I don't think people want to live in an area where it's polluted all the time. So it would definitely be a negative thing and it would probably be moderately negative."

      "question": "What might lead to increases or decreases in Upzoning policies, and how significant are these effects? Please also indicate if these influences are positive (increasing) or negative (decreasing).",
      "answer": "I think what would lead to increases or decreases in the policies is if people are requesting the changes in the policies and as far as how significant they would be. I think if they are life-changing, then they would be significant, and if they're not life-changing, then they would be insignificant, and regarding if they would be positive or negative, I think it would just depend on the changes in the policies."

      "answer": "I think with some things, it could be immediate, but overall, I do think we as people have to have patience. So with some changes, it would probably take a good amount of time to see any real change or effect from it. And I do believe, overall, it would have a positive effect and the effect would probably be somewhat strong."
