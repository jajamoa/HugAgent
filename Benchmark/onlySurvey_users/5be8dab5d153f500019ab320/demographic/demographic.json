    "housing_experience": "I've had three homes in the last five years although one of them I never spent any time in because it was a fixer upper that I ended up taking a big loss on because it was more work than I had the money for. I initially relocated because of a death in the family and I wanted to move closer to my remaining family. Right now I'm in a very small town, looking to flip the nice house I am and perhaps buy a condo or house closer to San Francisco, where the majority of my family lives.",
