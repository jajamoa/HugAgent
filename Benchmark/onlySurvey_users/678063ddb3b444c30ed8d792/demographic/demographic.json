    "housing_experience": "I've lived in the same one-bedroom apartment in Midtown for the past five years. When I first moved in, it was a good option for me since I was just entering my career and wanted to be close to downtown and have a relatively easy commute. Now that I'm more settled in my career as a software engineer, I still like the neighborhood and the independence of having my own place. While sometimes I do think about buying a property, the Houston real estate market is very competitive and I have not yet found my ideal match. For now, renting is still the most convenient option for me.",
