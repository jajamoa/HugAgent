    "housing_experience": "Over the past five years I\u2019ve stayed in the same townhouse in Chinatown Los Angeles. I haven\u2019t moved, but my rent has gradually risen from about $900 per month five years ago to $1,500 today. Each year when the lease renewed, the rent increase was a reminder of L.A.\u2019s tight housing market, but I\u2019ve chosen to stay put for the stability it provides and to keep my commute to school and work manageable.",
