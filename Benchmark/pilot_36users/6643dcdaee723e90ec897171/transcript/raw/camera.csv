Question Number,Question,Answer
1,To what extent do you support or oppose the widespread deployment of surveillance cameras in public spaces? Please explain your reasoning.,"I highly support surveillance cameras in public spaces. I feel like in this day and age, we need to have cameras to deter people from doing things and to find them faster when they do."
2,"What do you think are the most significant impacts, positive or negative, of increasing surveillance camera coverage in urban areas?",I think the negative side of it is that people think that they're constantly being watched and they think it's invasive. I think the positive side is that it deters crime.
3,How do you think surveillance technologies might affect public safety and crime rates?,"I think they'll help public safety, people will feel safer, people will be safer, and crime rates will drop dramatically in places that have cameras."
4,What impact do you believe increased surveillance might have on personal privacy and individual liberties?,"I think privacy is something that we need to learn to give up, to trade off, to be safer. I think we have to give up some of our rights because people just don't care anymore."
5,How do you think surveillance camera systems might affect community trust and police-community relations?,"I think the people that already don't like the police won't like them more. They'll be angrier at being watched by the police, but they probably have something to hide to begin with."
6,What role do you believe government should play in regulating surveillance technologies and data collection?,I'd rather have government regulations regarding surveillance than say city council or a private firm.
7,How might technological concerns about accuracy and reliability factor into decisions about surveillance systems?,The only thing I would be really worried about with reliability would be the cameras working all the time and the cost to keep them updated and then keeping them from being hacked.
8,"What economic effects, both positive and negative, might result from investing in widespread surveillance infrastructure?","Economically, I think it would pay off because the crime rates would drop, but it would be a negative to keep up with the technology and to keep them working."
9,How do you think the interests of law enforcement versus privacy advocates should be balanced when making surveillance policy?,"Well, I believe when they first put them into place, they could look into other countries that have done it, and where people felt that their privacies were okay, and they could find a balance together with new rules and regulations before it even gets started."
10,What role do you think social equity and potential bias play in discussions about surveillance technologies?,"I think that's something that would definitely have to be treaded carefully because there would be times where it would feel like they were being biased. However, let's look at the crime statistics."
11,How confident are you that changes in Deterrence lead to changes in Support for surveillance camera? Does it have a positive effect (increasing it) or a negative effect (decreasing it)? How strong is this effect?,I believe it would have a very strong positive effect on deterring crime.
12,"What do you think are the main causes of Support for surveillance camera, and how certain are you about these relationships? Please also indicate if these influences are positive (increasing) or negative (decreasing).","I think the crazier and worse our society gets, the more people that will be in support for surveillance cameras. I don't see it becoming negative, I see it becoming more positive."
13,How confident are you that changes in Public safety lead to changes in Support for surveillance camera? Does it have a positive effect (increasing it) or a negative effect (decreasing it)? How strong is this effect?,I am very confident that the changes in public safety are already leading to support for surveillance cameras.
14,How would you describe the relationship between Giving up rights and Support for surveillance camera? Is it a strong or weak connection? Does it have a positive effect (increasing it) or a negative effect (decreasing it)? How strong is this effect?,"I think 100% people have a strong argument that they're giving up rights in exchange for the surveillance cameras, but I think it's a right that we need to really think hard about. It may be worth giving up."
15,"Does Perception of being watched have a positive or negative effect on Support for surveillance camera, and how significant is this effect? Does it have a positive effect (increasing it) or a negative effect (decreasing it)? How strong is this effect?","Perception of being watched has a negative effect on support for surveillance camera. It's the one thing that deters me because nobody wants to feel like they're being watched all the time. But when you think about it, nobody is being watched 100% of the time. The surveillance cameras are there to look back when there's a problem or if they're looking for somebody specifically."
16,"Is the effect of City council on Support for surveillance camera immediate, or does it take time to develop? Does it have a positive effect (increasing it) or a negative effect (decreasing it)? How strong is this effect?",I think it takes time to develop. I think there's a lot of people that still don't want to do this.
17,"Would small changes in Cost of maintenance lead to noticeable changes in Support for surveillance camera, or would it take larger shifts? Does it have a positive effect (increasing it) or a negative effect (decreasing it)? How strong is this effect?",Small changes in cost of maintenance would not be a problem for people in support of the surveillance cameras. I believe that would be a small thing to give up. It would have a negative effect for any amount of money that it costs because that would be an argument for the people against it.
18,"Would small changes in Economic payoff lead to noticeable changes in Support for surveillance camera, or would it take larger shifts? Does it have a positive effect (increasing it) or a negative effect (decreasing it)? How strong is this effect?",small changes in economics would be a positive thing for the support of surveillance cameras say crime is cut down and there's less theft I think that would be a payoff economically
19,"Would small changes in Balancing privacy and surveillance lead to noticeable changes in Support for surveillance camera, or would it take larger shifts? Does it have a positive effect (increasing it) or a negative effect (decreasing it)? How strong is this effect?","Changes in balancing your privacy would probably be negative. Not small changes, but the larger changes would be a negative side."
20,"Does Careful Consideration have a positive or negative effect on Support for surveillance camera, and how significant is this effect? Does it have a positive effect (increasing it) or a negative effect (decreasing it)? How strong is this effect?","Yes, careful consideration does have a positive effect on the support for surveillance camera. Of course, anytime you take time to discuss and think about things, it's going to be positive."
21,"Would small changes in Crime deterrence lead to noticeable changes in Support for surveillance camera, or would it take larger shifts? Does it have a positive effect (increasing it) or a negative effect (decreasing it)? How strong is this effect?","To convince the people that were already against surveillance cameras, it would take very large ships and crime deterrents to convince them."
22,"What might lead to increases or decreases in Surveillance cameras, and how significant are these effects? Please also indicate if these influences are positive (increasing) or negative (decreasing).",It would take one person being falsely ID from a camera by the government and all heck would break loose. Any positive ground gained would be lost.
23,"Does Support for Surveillance Cameras have a positive or negative effect on Support for surveillance camera, and how significant is this effect? Does it have a positive effect (increasing it) or a negative effect (decreasing it)? How strong is this effect?",this question doesn't make sense but to answer it yes support for surveillance cameras has a positive effect on support for surveillance cameras it's positive very strong
24,"Does Positive effect have a positive or negative effect on Support for surveillance camera, and how significant is this effect? Does it have a positive effect (increasing it) or a negative effect (decreasing it)? How strong is this effect?","Okay, this is a silly question too. Yes, a positive effect does have a positive effect on support for surveillance cameras."
25,How confident are you that changes in Public resistance to surveillance cameras lead to changes in Support for surveillance camera? Does it have a positive effect (increasing it) or a negative effect (decreasing it)? How strong is this effect?,"I'm very confident that if we can get the public to stop resisting surveillance cameras, then we can get them to support it by data and proving that they work. There's plenty of other countries that use surveillance cameras for crime, and it's worked for them."
