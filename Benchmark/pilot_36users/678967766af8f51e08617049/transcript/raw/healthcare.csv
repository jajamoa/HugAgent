Question Number,Question,Answer
1,To what extent do you support or oppose universal healthcare policies that provide government-funded healthcare coverage for all citizens? Please explain your reasoning.,I'm somewhere in the middle. I would mostly be for it. The only reason I wouldn't be for it is because I would be worried about how it would be paid for and what type of care I would be receiving. It seems good in theory but there are issues with this in other countries that have universal health care and I don't trust our government or whoever would be overseeing our health care system to make this run efficiently and with the same level of care as private insurance.
2,"What do you think are the most significant impacts, positive or negative, of implementing a universal healthcare system?","Everyone would have access to treatment. Negatively, I can see a limited choice in providers, maybe a limited choice in care, longer waits for specialists or procedures, lack of options as far as hospitals or treatments, reduced choice, and obviously higher taxes that would pay for it. Negative."
3,How do you think universal healthcare policies might affect healthcare quality and accessibility?,"I think quality and accessibility could both decrease. People who have a lot of money will always be able to get a higher level of care and see a private physician. And I just see universal health care for everyone else being run like Medicaid, which is not the best."
4,What impact do you believe a universal healthcare system might have on medical innovation and research?,I think it might be slowed because there would be less money coming into the healthcare system and a change in focus on what treatment looks like.
5,How do you think universal healthcare might affect the economic burden on individuals and families?,"It would be good for people who don't have health coverage now and don't make a lot of money because they wouldn't be paying anything. It would be bad for people who pay the majority of taxes and people who are in an income bracket where taxes eat a large amount of their paycheck as it is, and they would be paying more."
6,What role do you believe government should play in healthcare delivery and financing?,"I don't know. There should definitely be some oversight in how it's implemented and carried out, but it should be run more like the health insurance companies than Medicaid."
7,How might healthcare provider concerns factor into decisions about universal healthcare implementation?,"I could definitely see their concerns being a factor in implementation. I'm sure a lot of providers, if given the opportunity, would opt out, just like they opt out of Medicaid now. So that would make it an unsustainable system and reduce accessibility if providers are not on board."
8,"What economic effects, both positive and negative, might result from transitioning to a universal healthcare system?",Higher taxes to implement it would be a negative. It could be positive if it turned out to be cheaper than health insurance or what people already pay out of pocket.
9,How do you think the interests of taxpayers versus healthcare consumers should be balanced when making healthcare policy?,"Well, the taxpayers are the healthcare consumers, so their interests are one and the same."
10,What role do you think social equity and access to care play in discussions about healthcare policy?,"It should play a role, but it shouldn't be the deciding factor."
11,"Is the effect of Government funding on Support for universal healthcare immediate, or does it take time to develop? Does it have a positive effect (increasing it) or a negative effect (decreasing it)? How strong is this effect?","It depends on how it hits people's pockets. If there's a large decrease to people's out-of-pocket expenses immediately, it would be immediate. If there's a large increase, it's immediate. If it was slow and developed over time, it would have less of an effect and possibly more positive effect."
12,"What might lead to increases or decreases in Support for universal healthcare, and how significant are these effects? Please also indicate if these influences are positive (increasing) or negative (decreasing).",There would definitely be an increase of support if people could maintain or improve their same level of care and access that they currently have and pay less. That would obviously be positive. Decrease in support would be caused by the opposite.
13,"Does Higher taxes have a positive or negative effect on Support for universal healthcare, and how significant is this effect? Does it have a positive effect (increasing it) or a negative effect (decreasing it)? How strong is this effect?",It has a negative effect. How big the effect is depends on how high the taxes would be and whether or not they would replace current health insurance and medical care costs.
14,"Would small changes in Healthcare quality lead to noticeable changes in Support for universal healthcare, or would it take larger shifts? Does it have a positive effect (increasing it) or a negative effect (decreasing it)? How strong is this effect?","I don't think small changes in quality would lead to noticeable changes in support unless it was accompanied by a financial change as well. If people were able to spend less money and have a higher quality, of course, this would have a positive effect in support. If there was a small change but it cost a lot more money, I think it would decrease support. If people felt like they were better off before, it would decrease support."
15,How would you describe the relationship between Less money in the healthcare system and Support for universal healthcare? Is it a strong or weak connection? Does it have a positive effect (increasing it) or a negative effect (decreasing it)? How strong is this effect?,I don't understand that question.
16,How confident are you that changes in Economic burden lead to changes in Support for universal healthcare? Does it have a positive effect (increasing it) or a negative effect (decreasing it)? How strong is this effect?,"It will definitely lend more support if the current economic burden was lessened. If taxes signifigantly rose it would decrease support, especially if you end up paying more than you already do for insurance."
17,How confident are you that changes in Healthcare delivery model lead to changes in Support for universal healthcare? Does it have a positive effect (increasing it) or a negative effect (decreasing it)? How strong is this effect?,I think it would have a strong effect. It would definitely lead to a decrease in support if accessibility and choice were decreased in any way.
18,"Does Provider opt-out have a positive or negative effect on Support for universal healthcare, and how significant is this effect? Does it have a positive effect (increasing it) or a negative effect (decreasing it)? How strong is this effect?","It depends on how many providers opt out and how much choice and access is left. If there's little choice and little access, I think it would decrease support for universal health care, and if the providers who opted out became more expensive or private health care insurance wasn't an option, it would further decrease options. And even the people that chose to stay private would probably even more negatively view universal health care because it would be costing them more, and they would probably still be paying taxes for it and don't even use it."
19,"Is the effect of Shared Interests on Support for universal healthcare immediate, or does it take time to develop? Does it have a positive effect (increasing it) or a negative effect (decreasing it)? How strong is this effect?",I don't understand what shared interest is.
20,"Does Healthcare Policy have a positive or negative effect on Support for universal healthcare, and how significant is this effect? Does it have a positive effect (increasing it) or a negative effect (decreasing it)? How strong is this effect?",I don't know what you mean by health care policy.
21,How confident are you that changes in Immediate Effect lead to changes in Support for universal healthcare? Does it have a positive effect (increasing it) or a negative effect (decreasing it)? How strong is this effect?,"It depends on what the immediate effects are. If the immediate effects are positive for everyone, it would increase support. If they were negative, it would decrease support. If people who didn't previously have health care now have access to free health care immediately, that would obviously immediately increase their support for it."
22,"Is the effect of Negative Effect on Support for universal healthcare immediate, or does it take time to develop? Does it have a positive effect (increasing it) or a negative effect (decreasing it)? How strong is this effect?",I don't understand the question.
23,How confident are you that changes in Positive effect on support lead to changes in Support for universal healthcare? Does it have a positive effect (increasing it) or a negative effect (decreasing it)? How strong is this effect?,I don't understand that question. 
24,How confident are you that changes in Positive Effect lead to changes in Support for universal healthcare? Does it have a positive effect (increasing it) or a negative effect (decreasing it)? How strong is this effect?,Duplicate question. I don't understand what you mean.
25,What causes changes in Universal healthcare? Are these influences strong or weak?,"Changes would be provider, quality, services provided, how long it takes to get them, how much it costs. All these things are strong influences."
26,"Would small changes in Accessibility lead to noticeable changes in Support for universal healthcare, or would it take larger shifts? Does it have a positive effect (increasing it) or a negative effect (decreasing it)? How strong is this effect?","Small changes in accessibility would lead to a negative effect if people had to wait longer or didn't have options for what hospital they wanted to go to, what treatments they could have, what doctors they could see. If it was ran like Medi-Cal, it's going to have a very negative effect on the majority of people who currently have health insurance, and it's a very, very strong effect."
