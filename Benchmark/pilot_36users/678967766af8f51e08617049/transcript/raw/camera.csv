Question Number,Question,Answer
1,To what extent do you support or oppose the widespread deployment of surveillance cameras in public spaces? Please explain your reasoning.,I generally do not support it and consider it an invasion of privacy.
2,"What do you think are the most significant impacts, positive or negative, of increasing surveillance camera coverage in urban areas?","I think the most significant impacts are definitely invasion of privacy, possible wrongful profiling. And it could lead to catching more criminals or a possible deterrent."
3,How do you think surveillance technologies might affect public safety and crime rates?,"I don't see it being a huge deterrent, but I think more criminals could be caught if there was surveillance."
4,What impact do you believe increased surveillance might have on personal privacy and individual liberties?,I think it's a huge invasion of personal privacy. Nobody wants to live in a dystopian society where we're being monitored and watched all the time.
5,How do you think surveillance camera systems might affect community trust and police-community relations?,"I don't see how it would have an effect on those things, except negatively. The police watching us, now you've got cameras watching us too. I don't see how that would lend any positive feelings towards the police."
6,What role do you believe government should play in regulating surveillance technologies and data collection?,"If the government is the one that's doing surveillance technologies and data collection, they should have a huge role in why, how, when and where it's collected and what happens to it and how it's used."
7,How might technological concerns about accuracy and reliability factor into decisions about surveillance systems?,It could be a great factor because people could be wrongly identified in crimes.
8,"What economic effects, both positive and negative, might result from investing in widespread surveillance infrastructure?",It would definitely have a negative economic effect because anything that's implemented is going to be paid for by the taxpayers. And we don't need more taxes.
9,How do you think the interests of law enforcement versus privacy advocates should be balanced when making surveillance policy?,"Both sides should have a say, there should be an open forum where concerns from both sides are put on the table and find a solution that works for both sides."
10,What role do you think social equity and potential bias play in discussions about surveillance technologies?,It plays a huge role as racial profiling is already a huge issue. Surveillance could make it even easier to wrongly profile certain people.
11,How confident are you that changes in Privacy lead to changes in Support for surveillance camera? Does it have a positive effect (increasing it) or a negative effect (decreasing it)? How strong is this effect?,Changes in privacy will lead to a negative effect for surveillance cameras but I don't think this effect is strong because the government is going to do what they want to do regardless of how people feel about it.
12,What causes changes in Support for surveillance camera? Are these influences strong or weak?,"I think how it's used and also seeing benefits such as lower crime that can be directly attributed to the surveillance cameras would increase support for it. But if there were high instances of wrongful profiling and people being unjustly identified or wrongly identified, it would definitely influence it negatively."
13,"Does wrongful profiling have a positive or negative effect on Support for surveillance camera, and how significant is this effect? Does it have a positive effect (increasing it) or a negative effect (decreasing it)? How strong is this effect?",It definitely has a negative effect on support. I think the effect is quite strong.
14,"Is the effect of Criminal Detection on Support for surveillance camera immediate, or does it take time to develop? Does it have a positive effect (increasing it) or a negative effect (decreasing it)? How strong is this effect?","Overall, I think it will take time to develop. We have to see what is the outcome. Does it have positive or negative effects overall in society that will determine how strong the effect is and exactly what the effect is."
15,"Does Personal privacy have a positive or negative effect on Support for surveillance camera, and how significant is this effect? Does it have a positive effect (increasing it) or a negative effect (decreasing it)? How strong is this effect?",Personal privacy would have a negative effect because it goes against everything surveillance cameras are. The effect would be quite strong. The argument would be quite strong against surveillance when you consider personal privacy.
16,How would you describe the relationship between Increased monitoring and Support for surveillance camera? Is it a strong or weak connection? Does it have a positive effect (increasing it) or a negative effect (decreasing it)? How strong is this effect?,"Increased monitoring and support for surveillance cameras are one in the same. I guess they would have a positive effect on each other, it's the same thing."
17,"Does Wrongful identification have a positive or negative effect on Support for surveillance camera, and how significant is this effect? Does it have a positive effect (increasing it) or a negative effect (decreasing it)? How strong is this effect?",It definitely would have a negative effect on support. How significant it is depends on how often it happens and who it happens to.
18,How confident are you that changes in Taxpayer Burden lead to changes in Support for surveillance camera? Does it have a positive effect (increasing it) or a negative effect (decreasing it)? How strong is this effect?,"Taxpayer burden would definitely negatively affect support for surveillance cameras. I think even for people who otherwise would be supportive of them, the tax burden may deter them and send them in the other direction."
19,"Would small changes in Balanced Solution lead to noticeable changes in Support for surveillance camera, or would it take larger shifts? Does it have a positive effect (increasing it) or a negative effect (decreasing it)? How strong is this effect?",It depends on what the balanced solution is and in whose favor it mostly is. It could have a more positive effect for the argument for surveillance cameras if there was a true balanced solution and a general consensus and agreement.
20,How would you describe the relationship between potential bias and Support for surveillance camera? Is it a strong or weak connection? Does it have a positive effect (increasing it) or a negative effect (decreasing it)? How strong is this effect?,There's a direct relationship that would decrease support for surveillance cameras. Potential bias and wrongful identification is probably one of the biggest arguments against surveillance next to lack of privacy in general.
21,How would you describe the relationship between racial profiling and Support for surveillance camera? Is it a strong or weak connection? Does it have a positive effect (increasing it) or a negative effect (decreasing it)? How strong is this effect?,"People who are used to being racially profiled and wrongly accused are going to have a much lower level of support for surveillance cameras. It's a very strong connection. There's an automatic negative connotation and distrust to the idea, and the effect is quite strong, especially if there were to be multiple instances of racial profiling and wrongful identification once these cameras are everywhere."
22,"Would small changes in Support for surveillance cameras lead to noticeable changes in Support for surveillance camera, or would it take larger shifts? Does it have a positive effect (increasing it) or a negative effect (decreasing it)? How strong is this effect?",I don't think small changes would have any noticeable change in support.
23,"How would you describe the relationship between Perceived benefits (e.g., lower crime) and Support for surveillance camera? Is it a strong or weak connection? Does it have a positive effect (increasing it) or a negative effect (decreasing it)? How strong is this effect?","There's definitely a relationship, and I think proven perceived benefits that were directly attributed to surveillance cameras would definitely increase support. I think the effect would be quite strong, especially during an election year for the candidate in favor."
24,How would you describe the relationship between Negative Effect on Support and Support for surveillance camera? Is it a strong or weak connection? Does it have a positive effect (increasing it) or a negative effect (decreasing it)? How strong is this effect?,I don't understand that question.
25,"What factors affect Surveillance cameras in public spaces, and which ones have the strongest influence? Please also indicate if these influences are positive (increasing) or negative (decreasing).","I think everyone would agree that it's an invasion of privacy. I think proponents for the surveillance cameras would cite a possible decrease in crime, seeing them as a deterrent. And also people who commit crimes, there could be a higher chance of them being caught, which would also lead to support for the cameras."
