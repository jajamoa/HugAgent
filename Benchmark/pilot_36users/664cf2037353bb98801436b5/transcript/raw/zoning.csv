6,Excellent! We're now ready to begin the interview about urban zoning policies. Take your time with each response and provide as much detail as you'd like. Let's start with our first question.,"OK, Iâ€™m ready. Whatâ€™s our first question?"
7,To what extent do you support or oppose upzoning policies that allow for higher density housing in traditionally single-family neighborhoods? Please explain your reasoning.,"honestly, I have mixed feelings. It could bring more life but I would be worried about it changing the towns feel and things like parking. I guess it would depend."
8,"What do you think are the most significant impacts, positive or negative, of increasing housing density in residential neighborhoods?",I believe that more people could definitely help local businesses and a positive way. But more traffic could mean less parking spaces. Which is honestly a real headache where I live. I also think that it could change the neighborly feel
9,How do you think upzoning policies might affect housing affordability in urban areas?,I donâ€™t personally live in a big urban area. I live more in a small town and rural area. But I can see how allowing more more housing could bring prices down a bit. more apartments or more townhouses could mean more options for people who canâ€™t afford a family home in the big city! But then again if everyone wanted to live in those areas the demands might still keep those prices up. Itâ€™s tricky in my opinion .
10,What impact do you believe increased housing density might have on neighborhood character and quality of life?,"honestly, it could go either way where I live in Lewistown, Pennsylvania because if they just start cramming buildings in without thinking well then yes it could definitely change the feel of some older neighborhoods i like. In my opinion more noise, less green space, etc. but if itâ€™s done thoughtfully maybe adding some smaller apartment buildings that fit it he existing houses might not be such a big deal. I think it could even bring some energy without losing the charm. I mean in general and in all honesty it really depends on how they go about it, if that makes sense at all!"
11,How do you think upzoning might affect transportation systems and traffic congestion in cities?,in a bigger city I can only imagine it could be a lot worse if they added a bunch more people without also improving the roads or public transportation. More people means more cars thatâ€™s just fact. So unless they really invest in things like buses or trains at the same time itâ€™s seems like up zoning could definitely make traffic a bigger problem in areas like the city!
12,What role do you believe local government should play in regulating housing development and density?,"I think the local government plays a big role! mainly because they need to think long-term, just like all communities and nations and people do, not just whatâ€™s happening right now. they should definitely listen to people and what they want for the town. Setting some rules bout how dense things can get, where new buildings can go, making sure thereâ€™s enough parking spaces, also green space is very important too in my opinion. Itâ€™s about finding a balance that literally works for everyone equally and fair!"
13,How might environmental concerns factor into decisions about urban density and zoning?,"well, for example, where I live in PA we care about keeping things clean and green. in larger and bigger cities itâ€™s probably even more important. I feel like they need to consider things like green spaces and maybe parks or just more trees along the streets. I think how the building is designed is important too. Things like using energy and making sure theyâ€™re not blocking sunlight for other buildings. Also have to thing about managing waste and water PROPERLY! So it doesnâ€™t harm our environment."
14,"What economic effects, both positive and negative, might result from changing zoning laws to allow more multi-family housing?",Some positives would be more people living closer to downtown could mean more customers for our local shops and restaurants. Maybe some new buisnesses would open up to! Or could also create more construction jobs. On the downside it could change the character of the neighborhoods too much meaning that it might make some people who currently live here or there want to move out which could be bad for the local economy! property values could also possibly change which could ultimately affect property taxes. Feels like itâ€™s a bit like gambling.
15,How do you think the interests of current residents versus future residents should be balanced when making zoning decisions?,"You have people who have lived here their entire lives. They like things the way they are and their opinions matter. You also want it to be a place where younger people can afford to live and raise a family so you have to think about the future. our local government really needs to listen to every one every local resident every citizen, etc.. get their feedback!"
16,What role do you think social equity and access to opportunity play in discussions about zoning and housing policy?,if we only allow single-family homes in certain areas it can keep housing prices high and make it harder for people with lower incomes to live in those neighborhoods. Which might have better schools and education and better job opportunities. Thinking about social equity means making sure everyone has a fair shot at finding a decent place to live and access what the town has to offer. Zoning policies should try to create more diverse housing options so itâ€™s not just for one group of people.
17,"Does Potential benefits of higher density housing have a positive or negative effect on Support for Upzoning, and how significant is this effect? Does it have a positive effect (increasing it) or a negative effect (decreasing it)? How strong is this effect?",If I saw real benefits to higher density like more local businesses or lower housing costs eventually that would make me more open to upzoning so it would have a positive impact and increases my support! I would say that itâ€™s definitely significant if I could see the upsides for the town and its residents I would be much more willing to get past some of the concerns about change. if the benefits seemed small or uncertain then I would probably be less supportive.
18,"Does Housing Prices have a positive or negative effect on Support for Upzoning, and how significant is this effect? Does it have a positive effect (increasing it) or a negative effect (decreasing it)? How strong is this effect?","A few things that could change my opinion towards zoning would be the potential for increased local businesses Worries about traffic nd parking seeing more cars and less parking around town is a negative influence. 
affordability of housing. if up zoning seemed like could make house more affordable for young people or those struggling that would definitely be a positive and a strong influence. Also, if the local government had a clear plan and involve the community that would be extremely positive!"
19,"What factors affect Positive impact on local businesses, and which ones have the strongest influence? Please also indicate if these influences are positive (increasing) or negative (decreasing).",if housing prices got high the idea that up zoning could lower them would positively affect my opinion and support but if prices were okay or if i was worried about my property value it could negatively affect my support. it honestly depends on the situation.
20,"What factors do you think influence Support for Upzoning, and how strong is their impact? Please also indicate if these influences are positive (increasing) or negative (decreasing).",My support for up zoning depends on more local businesses - positive-strong. Traffic/parking worries - negative. Potential for more affordable housing - positive. How well itâ€™s planned with community input - positive.
21,"Is the effect of Increased traffic on Support for Upzoning immediate, or does it take time to develop? Does it have a positive effect (increasing it) or a negative effect (decreasing it)? How strong is this effect?",The worry about increased traffic on my support for up zoning would be pretty immediate and negative. Even the thought of more conjestion on our local roads especially during rush-hour or around school times makes me less supportive right away. Traffic flow impacts daily life here.
22,How confident are you that changes in More housing options lead to changes in Support for Upzoning? Does it have a positive effect (increasing it) or a negative effect (decreasing it)? How strong is this effect?,Iâ€™m moderately confident that more housing options could lead to more support for up zoning. More people could afford to live here especially younger families or those just starting out that generally increases my support. Itâ€™s a positive effect.
23,"Is the effect of Neighborhood character on Support for Upzoning immediate, or does it take time to develop? Does it have a positive effect (increasing it) or a negative effect (decreasing it)? How strong is this effect?","It would have a negative effect on my support. I value the look and feel and environment of the neighborhoods around here and the thought of that changing quickly with new, denser developments makes me less supportive right away. Itâ€™s strong because itâ€™s about the place. I call home."
24,"Would small changes in Traffic Congestion lead to noticeable changes in Support for Upzoning, or would it take larger shifts? Does it have a positive effect (increasing it) or a negative effect (decreasing it)? How strong is this effect?","It would likely lead to noticeable negative changes in my support for zoning, the effect would probably be strong. enough to make me think twice about supporting more density . it wouldnâ€™t take a huge increase to make me feel less favorable towards it."
25,"Does Increased Population have a positive or negative effect on Support for Upzoning, and how significant is this effect? Does it have a positive effect (increasing it) or a negative effect (decreasing it)? How strong is this effect?","Increased population would have a negative effect on my support. some growth is OK, a notable increase could strain our local resources like schools and roads and it might change the small town feeling I appreciate. The strength of this negative effect would probably be strong or somewhat strong. Depending on how significant the population increase was projected."
26,How would you describe the relationship between Balanced fairness and Support for Upzoning? Is it a strong or weak connection? Does it have a positive effect (increasing it) or a negative effect (decreasing it)? How strong is this effect?,The relationship between balanced fairness and support for up zoning would be positive and strong! If I believed that the zoning plan was well thought out and planned and aimed for balanced outcomes that were fair to everyone involved my support would definitely increase a lot. And on the other hand if I thought the potential outcomes were unfair my support would decrease. Fairness is a big deal to me personally!
27,"Would small changes in Environmental cleanliness lead to noticeable changes in Support for Upzoning, or would it take larger shifts? Does it have a positive effect (increasing it) or a negative effect (decreasing it)? How strong is this effect?","Even small changes in environmental cleanliness in Lewistown would likely lead to notable negative changes in my support. We value the natural beauty around here and even a slight increase in littering and litter in general, pollution or strain on resources due to increased density would be very concerning. The effect would be strong but on the other hand small positive changes in environmental cleanliness that were clearly linked to a thoughtful up zoning plan like more green spaces or better infrastructure could lead to a positive in my support."
28,How confident are you that changes in Support for local businesses lead to changes in Support for Upzoning? Does it have a positive effect (increasing it) or a negative effect (decreasing it)? How strong is this effect?,I am strongly confident that changes in my support for local businesses would lead to changes in my support. it has a positive effect. if I saw clear evidence that upzoning was helping our local shops and restaurants thrive the en maybe more foot traffic and. new businesses opening then my support would definitely increase. If it was more obvious that more residents living closer to downtown were spending money locally the effect would definitely be stronger.A boost to our local businesses is a big plus for me personally.
29,"Does Local government listening have a positive or negative effect on Support for Upzoning, and how significant is this effect? Does it have a positive effect (increasing it) or a negative effect (decreasing it)? How strong is this effect?",local government listening would have a strong positive effect on my support. If I felt like our local government was truly listening and hearing our concerns and ideas of the community and holding discussions and debates and taking feedback seriously along with being transparent about their plans I would definitely be much more supportive to changes even if I had some reservations about to. It builds trust and makes me feel like the outcome will be better for everyone. If I felt like decisions were being made without our input that would create strong negative feelings and decrease my support.
30,How would you describe the relationship between Social Equity and Support for Upzoning? Is it a strong or weak connection? Does it have a positive effect (increasing it) or a negative effect (decreasing it)? How strong is this effect?,Social equity has a strong positive connection to my support for upzoning. if it means a fairer town with more opportunities for everyone.  IM ALL FOR IT. if it makes things less fair. Then I am ALL AGAINST IT!
31,"Does Access to Opportunity have a positive or negative effect on Support for Upzoning, and how significant is this effect? Does it have a positive effect (increasing it) or a negative effect (decreasing it)? How strong is this effect?","access to opportunities has a strong positive effect on my support for up zoning. If I believe that allowing more diverse housing options and potentially increasing population density could lead to more jobs, better, school schools, improved public transportation, these benefit everyone in town. I would definitely be much more likely to support it. The idea of having more opportunities for me and my family and community is a big motivator. If upzoning seemed like it would limit opportunities or make things harder for people in the community including myself then my support would definitely decreasing."
32,"Would small changes in Affordability of housing lead to noticeable changes in Support for Upzoning, or would it take larger shifts? Does it have a positive effect (increasing it) or a negative effect (decreasing it)? How strong is this effect?",even small improvements in housing affordability due to upzoning would increase my support.
