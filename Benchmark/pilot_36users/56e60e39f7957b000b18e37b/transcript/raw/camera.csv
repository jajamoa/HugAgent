Question Number,Question,Answer
1,To what extent do you support or oppose the widespread deployment of surveillance cameras in public spaces? Please explain your reasoning.,"I oppose widespread surveillance, it is an invasion of privacy and I don't believe in trading privacy for safety because that's never the end result. It is always abused and government never relinquishes power."
2,"What do you think are the most significant impacts, positive or negative, of increasing surveillance camera coverage in urban areas?",I think criminals will just wear masks and still commit crimes anyway. They really don't do much good
3,How do you think surveillance technologies might affect public safety and crime rates?,Sure you might catch a criminal here and there because of cameras but the constant invasion of privacy is not worth occasionally catching a criminal.
4,What impact do you believe increased surveillance might have on personal privacy and individual liberties?,I believe that personal privacy and liberties are at complete risk when it comes to surveillance technologies which are ripe for abuse.
5,How do you think surveillance camera systems might affect community trust and police-community relations?,I think police will just abuse the surveillance systems and people will be targeted and profiled more.
6,What role do you believe government should play in regulating surveillance technologies and data collection?,"Government should not be collecting mass data, other than that, I don't care what they do as long as they are not the ones gathering and collecting this data."
7,How might technological concerns about accuracy and reliability factor into decisions about surveillance systems?,I think surveillance are not invulnerable to hacks and so this is a valid concern with surveillance systems.
8,"What economic effects, both positive and negative, might result from investing in widespread surveillance infrastructure?",More jobs will be made at factories producing these chips and cameras.
9,How do you think the interests of law enforcement versus privacy advocates should be balanced when making surveillance policy?,I think the scale should always tip in favor of the private citizen or the privacy advocates.
10,What role do you think social equity and potential bias play in discussions about surveillance technologies?,They are going to be brought up when it comes to the placement and use of these technologies inevitably and I don't have an opinion either way other than they are easily abused in many ways not just racial profiling.
11,"Would small changes in Privacy lead to noticeable changes in Support for surveillance camera, or would it take larger shifts? Does it have a positive effect (increasing it) or a negative effect (decreasing it)? How strong is this effect?","Yes, small changes in privacy snowball and soon rights become eroded and it's not a path I want to see this country go down any further. It is like a snowball rolling down a hill gaining more and more size and momentum."
12,"What factors affect Support for surveillance camera, and which ones have the strongest influence? Please also indicate if these influences are positive (increasing) or negative (decreasing).","In the case of violent gun crime for identifying suspects I can see an argument but then again shotspotter can do that, there is no reason to be recording video of everyone so it can be used to train AI facial recognition and other security state technologies."
13,"Does Criminals adapting to surveillance have a positive or negative effect on Support for surveillance camera, and how significant is this effect? Does it have a positive effect (increasing it) or a negative effect (decreasing it)? How strong is this effect?","It reduces my support because obviously criminals will avoid cameras. It has a negative effect on my support because only the criminals will avoid the cameras, law abiding citizens will not and have their privacy violated."
14,How confident are you that changes in Public Safety lead to changes in Support for surveillance camera? Does it have a positive effect (increasing it) or a negative effect (decreasing it)? How strong is this effect?,Changes in public safety lead to changes in support for surveillance when public safety is negatively impacted for example by rising gun crime.
15,"Would small changes in Privacy Invasion lead to noticeable changes in Support for surveillance camera, or would it take larger shifts? Does it have a positive effect (increasing it) or a negative effect (decreasing it)? How strong is this effect?","Yes, people don't want their privacy violated and even small intrusions will spark a backlash."
16,"Is the effect of Personal Privacy on Support for surveillance camera immediate, or does it take time to develop? Does it have a positive effect (increasing it) or a negative effect (decreasing it)? How strong is this effect?",It is immediate and does not take time to develope because the technology operates in real time.
17,"Is the effect of Individual Liberties on Support for surveillance camera immediate, or does it take time to develop? Does it have a positive effect (increasing it) or a negative effect (decreasing it)? How strong is this effect?","It is immediate because people's lives are immediately impacted, especially privacy."
18,"Is the effect of Risk of Abuse on Support for surveillance camera immediate, or does it take time to develop? Does it have a positive effect (increasing it) or a negative effect (decreasing it)? How strong is this effect?",It is immediate because cameras operate in real time and that footage must be stored somewhere making it ripe for abuse.
19,"Does Police abuse have a positive or negative effect on Support for surveillance camera, and how significant is this effect? Does it have a positive effect (increasing it) or a negative effect (decreasing it)? How strong is this effect?","Police abuse has a negative effect on support for surveillance, unless that surveillance is in the form of body cameras used to hold police accountable."
20,"Would small changes in Government Regulation lead to noticeable changes in Support for surveillance camera, or would it take larger shifts? Does it have a positive effect (increasing it) or a negative effect (decreasing it)? How strong is this effect?","Yes, even small erosions of freedoms will be exponentially worse over time."
21,"Does Reliability have a positive or negative effect on Support for surveillance camera, and how significant is this effect? Does it have a positive effect (increasing it) or a negative effect (decreasing it)? How strong is this effect?","Reliability is irrelevant as in the case of Jeffery Epstein, here there were surveillance technology and yet his murder's are still free and there is no video of his ""suicide""."
22,"Does Surveillance systems have a positive or negative effect on Support for surveillance camera, and how significant is this effect? Does it have a positive effect (increasing it) or a negative effect (decreasing it)? How strong is this effect?",Surveillance systems clearly have a negative effect on support for surveillance cameras because no one wants to be monitored 24/7.
23,How confident are you that changes in Job creation lead to changes in Support for surveillance camera? Does it have a positive effect (increasing it) or a negative effect (decreasing it)? How strong is this effect?,I don't think this is related unless the factories producing the cameras are actually in the communities where they are used and not sourced overseas.
24,"Does Private Citizens have a positive or negative effect on Support for surveillance camera, and how significant is this effect? Does it have a positive effect (increasing it) or a negative effect (decreasing it)? How strong is this effect?",Private citizens will have a negative view on surveillance because it is a violation of the right to privacy. It is a strong effect.
25,How would you describe the relationship between Surveillance Policy and Support for surveillance camera? Is it a strong or weak connection? Does it have a positive effect (increasing it) or a negative effect (decreasing it)? How strong is this effect?,"Surveillance policy will lose support when surveillance cameras are involved because they are always working when no crimes are happening and when they are needed like in the case of Epstein they just happen to be be ""down"". So they are clearly easily abused."
26,How would you describe the relationship between potential bias and Support for surveillance camera? Is it a strong or weak connection? Does it have a positive effect (increasing it) or a negative effect (decreasing it)? How strong is this effect?,The relationship is that people who are against surveillance will not like surveillance cameras and those who want to trade their privacy for safety will like surveillance cameras.
27,"What might lead to increases or decreases in Surveillance cameras, and how significant are these effects? Please also indicate if these influences are positive (increasing) or negative (decreasing).",I think government giving out ridiculously high contracts to private companies who helped politicians get elected who then turn around and award them with these lucrative deals in return.
