5,"As the interview progresses, you'll notice the progress bar at the top of the screen showing your current position. Based on your responses, the system may generate follow-up questions to dive deeper into specific topics. These new questions will be added to your interview flow automatically. This helps us capture your thinking process more thoroughly.","Okay, understood."
6,Excellent! We're now ready to begin the interview about urban zoning policies. Take your time with each response and provide as much detail as you'd like. Let's start with our first question.,Okay.
7,To what extent do you support or oppose upzoning policies that allow for higher density housing in traditionally single-family neighborhoods? Please explain your reasoning.,"I support them practically entirely, because more housing is important for people who need it."
8,"What do you think are the most significant impacts, positive or negative, of increasing housing density in residential neighborhoods?",Positive impacts are that people can find homes more easily. Negative impacts might be that there will be overcrowding.
9,How do you think upzoning policies might affect housing affordability in urban areas?,"They would make housing a lot more affordable, because the more housing there is, the less they will be due to more availability."
10,What impact do you believe increased housing density might have on neighborhood character and quality of life?,"Neighborhood character would increase positively because people will feel welcomed into the community. Quality of life might be more hectic in terms of travel, but people will still be able to easily manage."
11,How do you think upzoning might affect transportation systems and traffic congestion in cities?,"There will definitely be an increase in traffic, but I am sure there can be policies to ease that burden and make things run as smoothly as possible."
12,What role do you believe local government should play in regulating housing development and density?,"They should help to fund it through a surplus. If not, they should explain to the general public why they should support housing developments."
13,How might environmental concerns factor into decisions about urban density and zoning?,"There would be a concern that climates can be negatively impacted due to carbon emissions going up, but emissions taxes could force people to do the right thing."
14,"What economic effects, both positive and negative, might result from changing zoning laws to allow more multi-family housing?","There will be a better economy due to a large flow of money coming in from extra residents. Negative impacts on the economy will be practically non-existent, unless there are stock shortages due to overpopulation."
15,How do you think the interests of current residents versus future residents should be balanced when making zoning decisions?,"They should both be taken into consideration equally, as no one resident matters more than another one."
16,What role do you think social equity and access to opportunity play in discussions about zoning and housing policy?,"They play huge roles, because it is important to have equity so that all people can feel welcome."
17,"Does Higher density housing have a positive or negative effect on Support for Upzoning, and how significant is this effect? Does it have a positive effect (increasing it) or a negative effect (decreasing it)? How strong is this effect?",A pretty significant positive effect.
18,"Would small changes in Housing availability lead to noticeable changes in Support for Upzoning, or would it take larger shifts? Does it have a positive effect (increasing it) or a negative effect (decreasing it)? How strong is this effect?",I think it is in proportion to the amount of changes.
19,"Does Negative impact: Overcrowding have a positive or negative effect on Support for Upzoning, and how significant is this effect? Does it have a positive effect (increasing it) or a negative effect (decreasing it)? How strong is this effect?",Negative. It has a huge negative impact because people do not like to feel overcrowded.
20,What causes changes in Support for Upzoning? Are these influences strong or weak?,"Things like overcrowding, environmental concerns, and pricing changes play major roles. They can all be strong influences."
21,"Does Housing affordability have a positive or negative effect on Support for Upzoning, and how significant is this effect? Does it have a positive effect (increasing it) or a negative effect (decreasing it)? How strong is this effect?","Strong positive effect. The more housing affordability there is, the more support there will be, as people like affordable things."
22,"Would small changes in Increased housing supply lead to noticeable changes in Support for Upzoning, or would it take larger shifts? Does it have a positive effect (increasing it) or a negative effect (decreasing it)? How strong is this effect?",There would need to be larger shifts. Small changes would only show small changes in support.
23,"Does Positive neighborhood character have a positive or negative effect on Support for Upzoning, and how significant is this effect? Does it have a positive effect (increasing it) or a negative effect (decreasing it)? How strong is this effect?","It has a major positive effect. If a neighborhood has a strong reputation, then there will be support for upzoning."
24,"Would small changes in Policies to ease traffic burden lead to noticeable changes in Support for Upzoning, or would it take larger shifts? Does it have a positive effect (increasing it) or a negative effect (decreasing it)? How strong is this effect?","Even small changes would increase support significantly, because no one likes traffic."
25,"Does Funding Housing Development have a positive or negative effect on Support for Upzoning, and how significant is this effect? Does it have a positive effect (increasing it) or a negative effect (decreasing it)? How strong is this effect?","It has a  large positive effect, as being funded would mean that most people would not be taxed just to pay for it."
26,"Does Environmental concerns have a positive or negative effect on Support for Upzoning, and how significant is this effect? Does it have a positive effect (increasing it) or a negative effect (decreasing it)? How strong is this effect?","If people are concerned about the environment, then they will be significantly less likely to support this, because they would feel it brings a negative impact."
27,"Does Carbon emissions have a positive or negative effect on Support for Upzoning, and how significant is this effect? Does it have a positive effect (increasing it) or a negative effect (decreasing it)? How strong is this effect?",Carbon emissions have a very negative effect. This is because no one wants bad things for the environment.
28,"Is the effect of Improved economy on Support for Upzoning immediate, or does it take time to develop? Does it have a positive effect (increasing it) or a negative effect (decreasing it)? How strong is this effect?","It takes years to develop, as the economy fluctuates a lot, so they would need a larger sample size of economic performance."
29,"Does Balanced decision-making have a positive or negative effect on Support for Upzoning, and how significant is this effect? Does it have a positive effect (increasing it) or a negative effect (decreasing it)? How strong is this effect?","It has a large positive effect, because seeing balance in decision making would make people trusting,"
30,How confident are you that changes in Inclusivity lead to changes in Support for Upzoning? Does it have a positive effect (increasing it) or a negative effect (decreasing it)? How strong is this effect?,"Very confident, because inclusivity shows that everyone is welcome, which would lead to vastly more support overall."
31,"What factors do you think influence Housing availability, and how strong is their impact? Please also indicate if these influences are positive (increasing) or negative (decreasing).","The economy, the environment, and potential taxes used to pay for it. These effects are all strong and crucial."
32,"Does Overcrowding have a positive or negative effect on Support for Upzoning, and how significant is this effect? Does it have a positive effect (increasing it) or a negative effect (decreasing it)? How strong is this effect?","Extremely negative, because people will feel like overcrowding will negatively impact their quality of life, as well as mobility."
