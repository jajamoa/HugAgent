6,What role do you believe government should play in regulating surveillance technologies and data collection?,They should ban surveillance technologies unless it is on private property and there is consent.
7,How might technological concerns about accuracy and reliability factor into decisions about surveillance systems?,Less accuracy and reliability would have strong negative impacts because people will feel violated both with privacy and safety.
8,"What economic effects, both positive and negative, might result from investing in widespread surveillance infrastructure?","Positive effects are less crime, which can help the economy because people would be more willing to go out and spend. Negative impacts are that people might even stay home because they do not want to be surveilled."

11,How confident are you that changes in Feeling of constant observation lead to changes in Support for surveillance camera? Does it have a positive effect (increasing it) or a negative effect (decreasing it)? How strong is this effect?,"It would have a strong negative effect, I am sure of it. People hate being watched, so there is almost no support for it to begin with."
12,What causes changes in Support for surveillance camera? Are these influences strong or weak?,"Feeling like privacy is still respected could positively impact support, but most people are already distrustful of agencies using surveillance, so this distrust would be pretty hard to overcome."

Does it have a positive effect (increasing it) or a negative effect (decreasing it)? How strong is this effect?","Strongly negative, because people do not play around with their privacy. No one wants to compromise on their feelings of remaining private."
16,"Would small changes in Less trust lead to noticeable changes in Support for surveillance camera, or would it take larger shifts? Does it have a positive effect (increasing it) or a negative effect (decreasing it)? How strong is this effect?","Yes, the less trust there is, the more negative effect it has on support. This is a strong impact."
17,"Is the effect of Fear of being watched on Support for surveillance camera immediate, or does it take time to develop?

19,How would you describe the relationship between Increased consumer spending and Support for surveillance camera? Is it a strong or weak connection? Does it have a positive effect (increasing it) or a negative effect (decreasing it)? How strong is this effect?,"There is no connection to this at all.

How strong is this effect?",A right to privacy would have a positive impact in a huge way if the surveillance has a proven track record of not being misused.
22,"Does Social equity have a positive or negative effect on Support for surveillance camera, and how significant is this effect? Does it have a positive effect (increasing it) or a negative effect (decreasing it)? How strong is this effect?","Social equity would have a positive impact in a huge way, as people feel there is currently bias in surveillance, so less bias would lead to more trust overall."

24,How would you describe the relationship between Strong negative effect and Support for surveillance camera? Is it a strong or weak connection? Does it have a positive effect (increasing it) or a negative effect (decreasing it)? How strong is this effect?,"Strong negative effects are negative by nature, so people would be a lot less likely to support surveillance this way."
25,What causes changes in Surveillance cameras in public spaces? Are these influences strong or weak?,"Maybe crime rates have an effect. The more crime there is, the more these cameras may be used. They are strong influences."
26,"Is the effect of Distrust in agencies on Support for surveillance camera immediate, or does it take time to develop?
