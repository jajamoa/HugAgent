    "housing_experience": "At first I was living in an apartment in a town.  I was living by myself and enjoyed it.  I had two bedrooms at a real affordable price and had no yard work to do whatsoever.  Two years ago, I bought a house and moved in.  I live alone.  I could have just kept living in my apartment and been happy, but I did what to build equity.  I don't like doing the repairs and the yard work though that comes along with it.",
