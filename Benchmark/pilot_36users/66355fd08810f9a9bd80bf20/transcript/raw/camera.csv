Question Number,Question,Answer
1,To what extent do you support or oppose the widespread deployment of surveillance cameras in public spaces? Please explain your reasoning.,"I am slightly supportive of it, I believe, more so than opposing. It seems like where we are in today's age, it makes kind of sense to have more security."
2,"What do you think are the most significant impacts, positive or negative, of increasing surveillance camera coverage in urban areas?","Positives are people may be aware the cameras are there On the other hand, it can feel weird to know"
3,How do you think surveillance technologies might affect public safety and crime rates?,"Off the top of my head, without any data to look at, I would say it would affect public safety and crime in a positive way. It might deter crime."
4,What impact do you believe increased surveillance might have on personal privacy and individual liberties?,"That's a tricky question because it depends on who has access to the cameras and what are they using them for? If you have just people, if you have people who are ethical in charge, you would be better off for it. If you have criminals in charge, that's going to be a problem. They could use this to abuse you and detain people they want to detain, etc."
5,How do you think surveillance camera systems might affect community trust and police-community relations?,"I can see both sides here. People who support the police in our community would probably feel this was great and they would feel safer. People who maybe mistrust or feel fearful of the community police, this would probably make them more fearful and more mistrustful."
6,What role do you believe government should play in regulating surveillance technologies and data collection?,"I'm torn on that. If you have an ethical government that you could trust, you would probably let them be in charge of this sort of thing. I know they probably do it now anyway through all the different social media that we use and then the different technologies in our home are basically wiretaps. I believe a good government should play that role, but it's hard to trust our government anymore."
7,How might technological concerns about accuracy and reliability factor into decisions about surveillance systems?,"There's always a concern. Technology is not infallible just like people. So there's always a concern that you can't a hundred percent rely on it. Especially what if someone doctored it or tampered with it and the average person looking at it can't tell. That's a problem. That's problematic. So there's definitely concerns about accuracy, safety, reliability, and what hands those are in and who uses it."
8,"What economic effects, both positive and negative, might result from investing in widespread surveillance infrastructure?","If it was like a federal initiative, we could use tax funded that people might not even notice the cost, but the likely event of that is using property taxes on a local level. So economically, that's probably costly. That's a negative. I guess the positive is that you might feel more safe."
9,How do you think the interests of law enforcement versus privacy advocates should be balanced when making surveillance policy?,"That's pretty tough. I feel like the interest of law enforcement should be taken into higher consideration in areas where there is a lot of violent crime and by that I mean person-on-person where people are harmed. I don't really care about capitalist violence per se, people who can't afford to eat and they steal food. I didn't see it. So there's a balance for sure. I think we should protect law enforcement as much as we can when it comes to protecting them from violence. So I would support more surveillance in areas where people are experiencing person-on-person violence versus other non-violent crimes."
10,What role do you think social equity and potential bias play in discussions about surveillance technologies?,"I think the concept of social equity is awesome and something that we should aspire to, and I vote in hopes of that happening one day, but it's not a reality in our society at all. Bias is a huge, plays a huge role in so many of our social issues. The lack of education surrounding that, the lack of emotional intelligence in people reaching adulthood is really staggering. It's frightening. I am trying my damnedest to raise my three kids with emotional intelligence and emotional regulation that can also think for themselves and have empathy. I think if we could raise more people like that into adulthood, we could solve problems about bias and social equity in a much greater capacity."
11,"Would small changes in Security concerns lead to noticeable changes in Support for surveillance camera, or would it take larger shifts? Does it have a positive effect (increasing it) or a negative effect (decreasing it)? How strong is this effect?",I don't know. I wish I had a better example of that. A small change in security. You mean cameras in parks or do you mean cameras in stores? I'm not sure what that looks like.
12,"What might lead to increases or decreases in Support for surveillance camera, and how significant are these effects? Please also indicate if these influences are positive (increasing) or negative (decreasing).","Okay, somebody experiencing a personal violent crime, that would lead to an increase in support for surveillance for sure. Somebody who had their car hit at Target and the person took off, they would hope they had surveillance cameras to help them in their case. Those effects are pretty significant. Those effects would increase support. The negative effects could be somebody who says they're unlawfully detained and they don't have access to the camera surveillance to prove it."
13,How confident are you that changes in Feeling of Being Watched lead to changes in Support for surveillance camera? Does it have a positive effect (increasing it) or a negative effect (decreasing it)? How strong is this effect?,"Depending on where these cameras are placed, I don't think feeling like you're being watched would really be that significant, but without an example, I can't know that, but I would say if you felt like you're being watched everywhere, that would probably decrease your support for surveillance. It would be a negative effect, medium strength maybe. Overall, I think we would just ignore they were there."
14,"Does Public Safety have a positive or negative effect on Support for surveillance camera, and how significant is this effect? Does it have a positive effect (increasing it) or a negative effect (decreasing it)? How strong is this effect?","Public safety definitely has a positive effect on support for surveillance. We want to feel safe in our community when we go out, when we do things in our homes, you name it, safety is our priority. And I think public safety especially, if you're being surveilled, at least if something happens to you, you have evidence for court or evidence for the police or anyone who would need it in your case."
15,"Is the effect of Personal privacy on Support for surveillance camera immediate, or does it take time to develop? Does it have a positive effect (increasing it) or a negative effect (decreasing it)? How strong is this effect?",It's probably immediate at the start and then the understanding of that or the awareness of that would fade in time. So probably it would have a positive effect. You're gonna kind of forget about it every time and then you'll get used to the surveillance being there and you won't care one way or the other which is kind of an implied support.
16,How would you describe the relationship between Trust in Government and Support for surveillance camera? Is it a strong or weak connection? Does it have a positive effect (increasing it) or a negative effect (decreasing it)? How strong is this effect?,"For most of us, probably a strong connection. If you don't trust the government, you probably don't support surveillance cameras installed by the local government. If you don't trust the government, but it's stores or parks doing it, you probably would support it because then you would feel safer. So the connection is definitely present. I guess the answer is who is in charge of installing the surveillance, who is doing the surveilling, and how is that surveillance being handled."
17,How would you describe the relationship between Reliability and Support for surveillance camera? Is it a strong or weak connection? Does it have a positive effect (increasing it) or a negative effect (decreasing it)? How strong is this effect?,"I feel like reliability and support, that relationship doesn't have much effect at all. I don't think the connection's big there. Technology is what it is on every level. We accept its flaws and we accept its mistakes now. I don't think that would really change. If people fear that it could be doctored with or tampered with, that would affect the support. But the actual technology itself, I think we trust and we understand that there will be some flaws."
18,"Is the effect of Trustworthiness on Support for surveillance camera immediate, or does it take time to develop? Does it have a positive effect (increasing it) or a negative effect (decreasing it)? How strong is this effect?","The effect of trustworthiness is probably pretty immediate, right, kind of goes in hand and hand with do we trust the government or do we trust whoever is doing the surveilling. It's that part, that relationship is the one. So if you feel it's trustworthy, you're going to be in support for it. If you don't feel it's trustworthy, it's not going to develop over time. It's going to be a negative effect. I think both of those things are immediate and don't really change."
19,How confident are you that changes in Tax-funded lead to changes in Support for surveillance camera? Does it have a positive effect (increasing it) or a negative effect (decreasing it)? How strong is this effect?,guess if if people don't notice it coming out of their pockets because it was like crowd tax funded that would probably increase support you know it's one thing if they say hey we're gonna pass another local sales tax and this is gonna fund us surveilling you people are going to say no to that but if they aren't aware that they're paying for it because it's coming out of taxes they already pay they'll support it
20,"Would small changes in Surveillance in high-violence areas lead to noticeable changes in Support for surveillance camera, or would it take larger shifts? Does it have a positive effect (increasing it) or a negative effect (decreasing it)? How strong is this effect?","Definitely that would be pretty immediate, right? Like you're gonna put surveillance in high crime areas. People are gonna support that because there that's areas where crime is noted and constantly happening and we're aware of it and it's areas that are less desirable that you might feel less safe going to. That could help the people who lived there feel more safe. It could help businesses feel more confident about staying open or even coming there at all."
21,How confident are you that changes in Potential Bias lead to changes in Support for surveillance camera? Does it have a positive effect (increasing it) or a negative effect (decreasing it)? How strong is this effect?,"I'm not confident about that at all. I think people who don't want to address implicit bias in themselves already have their opinions made up. They don't want to grow in that way. So I guess it would have a neutral effect, right? If you have, if you don't want to acknowledge your bias, you probably are going to be in support for this and you're going to just be thinking crime, crime, crime. If you are a little bit more rational about it, you might be able to, I guess, have a more neutral hand in that. You would want to see it carried out in a more equitable and just way because your bias isn't, the stereotypes in your head aren't guiding that decision like they are for people who haven't addressed their bias."
22,"Does Surveillance cameras have a positive or negative effect on Support for surveillance camera, and how significant is this effect? Does it have a positive effect (increasing it) or a negative effect (decreasing it)? How strong is this effect?",that question doesn't make sense does surveillance cameras have a positive or negative effect on support for surveillance cameras um so i guess that would be um i would say maybe a neutral effect right because if you support them then you did from the jump and if you didn't support them that's going to take time to increase your support you're going to need to see evidence that it's working in a positive way and then the support will come
23,"Would small changes in Positive influence on support lead to noticeable changes in Support for surveillance camera, or would it take larger shifts? Does it have a positive effect (increasing it) or a negative effect (decreasing it)? How strong is this effect?","I do think small changes and positive influence would lead to noticeable changes in support, right? So say that you put, there was a lot of theft in a parking lot at the park, and they put surveillance cameras in, and five months later, we find that the crimes in that parking lot have dropped by 75%. That word gets out, people have something substantial to look at and compare to, and I think that support other parks would adopt it. And then other stores would adopt it, and more and more people would trickle in to support for that. That's a pretty strong effect over time, but it's probably more of a trickle effect as it is implemented."
24,What causes changes in Surveillance cameras in public spaces? Are these influences strong or weak?,"Well, I guess what causes change is that crime is happening, crimes aren't being solved. Maybe things like that were the need for surveillance ever came into our mind in the first place. If people did what they were supposed to do and were trustworthy and on the right track all the time, we would never need to be surveilled. Unfortunately, that's just not what mankind is."
25,"Is the effect of Support for surveillance cameras on Support for surveillance camera immediate, or does it take time to develop? Does it have a positive effect (increasing it) or a negative effect (decreasing it)? How strong is this effect?","probably a little bit of both. There's people who automatically will support that because they want to support the police and they want to feel safe. And if they are told, they believe what they're told, hey, this will stop crime. Okay, I'm for it. It all sounds great on paper. And then there's others who've been harmed by systemic issues. And it's going to take a lot of time for them to trust this and build support, right? They would need to see it wasn't gonna be used to abuse or used to discriminate. If they are given evidence that it's being used correctly and justly, everyone would probably support it to some degree."
