Question Number,Question,Answer
1,To what extent do you support or oppose universal healthcare policies that provide government-funded healthcare coverage for all citizens? Please explain your reasoning.,"I support this to the fullest extent. I've experienced a lot of crap with our private, expensive healthcare, and I just think healthcare is a right for everybody to have."
2,"What do you think are the most significant impacts, positive or negative, of implementing a universal healthcare system?","Gosh, where to begin? I put I have private health care and it's expensive. I work my husband works. I have a degree And I still have to put off care. I have dental care right now I'm waiting on and what was one tooth has become two teeth. It sucks. I think that the most significant impacts are only positive"
3,How do you think universal healthcare policies might affect healthcare quality and accessibility?,"I think it would not affect quality in a negative way if we implement it correctly. I think it would affect accessibility in a temporary pattern. Right now, though, we have tons of money being funneled to the middleman. That money could go into the pot we're already paying and actually provide care. So, to me, that affects quality in a positive way and the accessibility I'm willing to be patient on."
4,What impact do you believe a universal healthcare system might have on medical innovation and research?,"I think it would still have a positive on innovation and research. We collect so, so, so, so much money in taxes in this country, and it would be great to have them used for such a better purpose. For the amount we're pouring into our private insurance, all of that could be going into the collective pot to help others and work on research. To me, it's a no-brainer."
5,How do you think universal healthcare might affect the economic burden on individuals and families?,"Universal health care would eliminate the economic burden on families. It is so expensive. I have three children. It is so expensive to raise kids in this country. We spend so much on health care, even just for little normal colds and flus through the year. The economic burden being gone would be a boon to our society's mental health alone."
6,What role do you believe government should play in healthcare delivery and financing?,"The government should play the biggest role. The federal government holds the purse of the nation. It's their responsibility to provide us representation for the taxes they collect. They currently do not do that. So it would be hard to trust them taking over healthcare delivery, but in the right hands and with people who are actually qualified at their jobs and know what they're doing, the research is there. We can follow other countries' examples and even edit ours to take out the issues other countries have. We could have the best model."
7,How might healthcare provider concerns factor into decisions about universal healthcare implementation?,"That's definitely a concern because I know, I'm a nurse, I know doctors and nurses get paid pretty well in our country compared to other countries. That said, if you take the millions of people who pay taxes but don't have healthcare now and they're now putting into that same pot, the amount of money we have going into that pot grows. The amount of money we're saving from not pouring it into healthcare company CEOs who don't even provide any form of care, the money is there. We would just have some rearranging to do. You could do, one thing would be to make healthcare providers college completely free."
8,"What economic effects, both positive and negative, might result from transitioning to a universal healthcare system?","There would be temporary negatives as we transitioned, I'm sure, but the overall positive results make it absolutely worth it in the long run. The transition could be a tough period, but again, we have nearly a century of examples to look at in other countries. So you put a team together, you study what works, what doesn't, make the changes necessary, tweak it, implement it, and it is possible."
9,How do you think the interests of taxpayers versus healthcare consumers should be balanced when making healthcare policy?,"I think health care is a human right. I think any other stance is ridiculous and not moral at all. So we're going to pay taxes we don't want to pay now. I don't want to fund a trillion dollar military, for example, but I do. I do my part as a citizen of this country and we all benefit when people are healthy. We all benefit when our society is well and our society is educated and taken care of because then their mental health is better and maybe that would bring down crime and gun crime especially."
10,What role do you think social equity and access to care play in discussions about healthcare policy?,"I think we know women have fared far worse in equity and access to care. We didn't even include women in medical studies until the late 90s. It's not a coincidence that women were becoming doctors more and working in Congress more at that time. It's as though for years and years, just men in charge didn't even realize that we were humans. So yes, equity and access to care definitely play an important role. This is race based and gender, all kinds of issues with that, but it's not unsolvable. We need the right people in charge. We need the right minds working on it."
11,How confident are you that changes in Universal healthcare lead to changes in Support for universal healthcare? Does it have a positive effect (increasing it) or a negative effect (decreasing it)? How strong is this effect?,"I'm confident that a vast majority of people in this country already support universal health care. I'm also confident that a large number of people in this country are led by fear and having people they trust speak and think for them. So there's a lot of hurdles to overcome to gain that support. Enough support needed to push Congress to act for us as opposed to the people who donate to their campaigns, which is historically all we've experienced in my adulthood. I wish that we would see the push for universal health care grow to a point that neither party could deny it any longer."
12,How would you describe the relationship between Government-funded healthcare and Support for universal healthcare? Is it a strong or weak connection? Does it have a positive effect (increasing it) or a negative effect (decreasing it)? How strong is this effect?,"I think for people who are conditioned and trained to mistrust the government, they probably don't support universal health care. They don't think the government is worthy, or capable, or ethical enough to carry it out in a fair way. And they're not completely wrong for those fears, as history books would show us. That said, I again think health care is a human right. We live in a wealthy country. Why do we not already have this?"
13,"Is the effect of Healthcare as a right on Support for universal healthcare immediate, or does it take time to develop? Does it have a positive effect (increasing it) or a negative effect (decreasing it)? How strong is this effect?","It's not immediate. It definitely takes time. It's messaging that gets railroaded by corporate liberals and all Republicans at every step of the way. Anytime we start talking about health care as a right or explaining what health care for all even looks like or means, it gets demonized immediately and our media is very happy to jump on that wagon and help fear-monger and mislead people into thinking it's just socialism and it can't work. The effect of that's pretty strong and it sucks and it's unfair. I don't know how you stop that. It's a machine that just keeps rolling."
14,"Is the effect of Access to care on Support for universal healthcare immediate, or does it take time to develop? Does it have a positive effect (increasing it) or a negative effect (decreasing it)? How strong is this effect?","I don't know a single person, Republican or Democrat or other, who doesn't think we should all have access to care. Every single person I talk to agrees that we should have care. The messaging gets lost when you start using terms like universal health care. Immediately, they're like, no, that's socialism. It's like it just, the cognitive dissonance is great. And media has done an amazing job of muddying that water over the years. We have a lot of deprogramming to get through for people to really grasp what it is. If we could get them there, that support is already there. It's almost universal now. People are just confused by what it means and how it would work."
15,"Is the effect of Positive impact on quality on Support for universal healthcare immediate, or does it take time to develop? Does it have a positive effect (increasing it) or a negative effect (decreasing it)? How strong is this effect?","takes time to develop, definitely not immediate on support. That would be a pretty strong effect for sure,"
16,"What factors affect Universal healthcare, and which ones have the strongest influence? Please also indicate if these influences are positive (increasing) or negative (decreasing).","So many factors affect universal health care, costs, fears about jobs, fears about coverage, access to coverage, quality of coverage. I think probably most people are afraid of access and quality to coverage changing. They're afraid that if 10 million people had care and they had waits before, what does it look like when 30 million people now have care but the amount of staff didn't go up? Influencing that positive but only with examples. It's negative until it's actually carried out because of fear."
17,How would you describe the relationship between Research funding and Support for universal healthcare? Is it a strong or weak connection? Does it have a positive effect (increasing it) or a negative effect (decreasing it)? How strong is this effect?,"I think most research shows positive benefits, positive outcomes, better morbidity, better mortality, better outcomes altogether are shown in our research for universal healthcare. Other countries have better lifespans than we do. They're healthier than us. They're less obese than us. They have a longer life than we do, and they have socialized healthcare with weights. The connection's strong, and it has a positive effect if you can get people to understand it."
18,"Would small changes in Economic burden lead to noticeable changes in Support for universal healthcare, or would it take larger shifts? Does it have a positive effect (increasing it) or a negative effect (decreasing it)? How strong is this effect?","Any reduction in economic burden would build support for universal health care by increasing it very strongly, very quickly. That's what you need people to understand. You're already paying a crap ton for your health care, and it doesn't cover everything, and you pay out of pocket every month. You could take all that you're spending now, put it into a tax, would not notice any difference in your income, but now you have a hundred percent coverage. Anything you need to see a doctor for, now you can, and then you don't get a bill. Get people to understand that, and we're golden."
19,"Is the effect of Government role in healthcare on Support for universal healthcare immediate, or does it take time to develop? Does it have a positive effect (increasing it) or a negative effect (decreasing it)? How strong is this effect?","I don't think in a country this size with this many states, it's possible to implement universal health care without the government playing the biggest role. So you do have to support the government doing that. I think the easier you can make this for people who are already paying out the pocket, the easier you make it for them, the more positive effect you get, the more increase in support you get. They're directly related."
20,How confident are you that changes in Trust in government lead to changes in Support for universal healthcare? Does it have a positive effect (increasing it) or a negative effect (decreasing it)? How strong is this effect?,"If people trust their government, they're more likely to trust changes in health care. They are more likely to support universal health care altogether if they trust that the people in charge of it have their best interest at heart. It's a positive effect there. If they don't trust the government, they're not going to trust universal health care at all. They're correlated."
21,How confident are you that changes in Universal healthcare implementation lead to changes in Support for universal healthcare? Does it have a positive effect (increasing it) or a negative effect (decreasing it)? How strong is this effect?,"I'm fairly confident if you implement universal healthcare, those changes are positive changes. It will trickle down to the masses and build support for universal healthcare. It would, over time, have an increased positive effect on support for universal healthcare."
22,How would you describe the relationship between System Adjustment and Implementation and Support for universal healthcare? Is it a strong or weak connection? Does it have a positive effect (increasing it) or a negative effect (decreasing it)? How strong is this effect?,"That's a strong connection. That's one negative aspect that probably decreases support. People are worried about how do you take this gigantic 50-state privatized multi-insurance company system that we currently have, how do you take that and adjust it and implement universal health care that's tax-funded? That is a very lofty undertaking. It's a valid concern and that definitely affects support. But if you can have all the kinks worked out and explain how it's going to work, you can still keep people from being too afraid of it."
23,How confident are you that changes in Societal benefits of health lead to changes in Support for universal healthcare? Does it have a positive effect (increasing it) or a negative effect (decreasing it)? How strong is this effect?,"If people in society recognize, oh wow, I used to spend $1,000 a month just for health care. My prescriptions were $200 a month. Now my taxes went up, but only $5,000 a year, so I'm saving $700 a month, and every time I go to the doctor, it's completely free. Do you see that? If you can get people to understand that, the societal benefit of the changes in health, they will 100% support universal health care. Very positive effect. Definitely increase strongly their support."
24,"Would small changes in Effect of messaging on healthcare lead to noticeable changes in Support for universal healthcare, or would it take larger shifts? Does it have a positive effect (increasing it) or a negative effect (decreasing it)? How strong is this effect?","I hope so. I think small changes, incremental changes on messaging is all this country is capable of. So I hope that those small changes in messaging can cause a societal and cultural shift to the left in support for universal health care. I think it would take time. It would be a trickle effect. But the more people that you convince of this, the more people that hopefully they add to their boat and that boat grows and hopefully that movement causes an increased positive effect toward getting access to health care for all."
