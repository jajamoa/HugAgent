Question Number,Question,Answer
1,To what extent do you support or oppose the widespread deployment of surveillance cameras in public spaces? Please explain your reasoning.,I support it 100% in public places.
2,"What do you think are the most significant impacts, positive or negative, of increasing surveillance camera coverage in urban areas?",I think increasing surveillance in urban areas would cut down on crime and help identify suspects.
3,How do you think surveillance technologies might affect public safety and crime rates?,I think crime rate would be lower and public safety would be better.
4,What impact do you believe increased surveillance might have on personal privacy and individual liberties?,"I believe there'd be a lot of complaint about it, but nobody would be affected as long as they weren't doing something they weren't supposed to."
5,How do you think surveillance camera systems might affect community trust and police-community relations?,I don't think anybody knows the difference.
6,What role do you believe government should play in regulating surveillance technologies and data collection?,I think the government should be the only one allowed to do it.
7,How might technological concerns about accuracy and reliability factor into decisions about surveillance systems?,"I guess all the surveillance cameras would have to be very high quality, you wouldn't want them and what good are they if they can't recognize a face?"
8,"What economic effects, both positive and negative, might result from investing in widespread surveillance infrastructure?",I think there's already enough money going into armored trucks and assault rifles for these police that they can afford to put up a few cameras.
9,How do you think the interests of law enforcement versus privacy advocates should be balanced when making surveillance policy?,"I think that surveillance cameras should be just that, surveillance. They don't need a bunch of hours, all they are is to, you know, watch for somebody breaking them up. And then if they turn into something else, worry about it then."
10,What role do you think social equity and potential bias play in discussions about surveillance technologies?,"You know, I think social inequity leads to crime, and I think that social bias is just honestly, it's just people telling the truth."
11,What causes changes in Surveillance cameras in public spaces? Are these influences strong or weak?,I think the changes in surveillance cameras make in public areas would be a huge change.
12,"Is the effect of Surveillance cameras in public spaces on Support for surveillance camera immediate, or does it take time to develop? Is it a positive influence (increases) or negative influence (decreases)? How strong is this effect?",I think it could be done almost immediately. We could have this change within a matter of months. The technology is already there.
13,"Would small changes in Crime reduction lead to noticeable changes in Support for surveillance camera, or would it take larger shifts? Does it have a positive effect (increasing it) or a negative effect (decreasing it)? How strong is this effect?","You know, it's only got to save one life."
14,How would you describe the relationship between Improved public safety and Support for surveillance camera? Is it a strong or weak connection? Does it have a positive effect (increasing it) or a negative effect (decreasing it)? How strong is this effect?,I'd say just a small amount of public safety improval would lead to a huge uprising for surveillance cameras approval rating.
15,"Would small changes in Personal privacy lead to noticeable changes in Support for surveillance camera, or would it take larger shifts? Does it have a positive effect (increasing it) or a negative effect (decreasing it)? How strong is this effect?","Yes, it would."
16,"Does Monopoly on regulation have a positive or negative effect on Support for surveillance camera, and how significant is this effect? Does it have a positive effect (increasing it) or a negative effect (decreasing it)? How strong is this effect?",I think Monopoly is going to have a negative effect on it. I don't think anybody's going to want just one company running it all.
17,"Would small changes in Face recognition capability lead to noticeable changes in Support for surveillance camera, or would it take larger shifts? Does it have a positive effect (increasing it) or a negative effect (decreasing it)? How strong is this effect?","It'd make a huge difference if they could increase the accuracy of their facial recognition, because right now, they just can't get it right, and half the time, the image on the photo is just blurry."
18,How would you describe the relationship between Law enforcement needs and Support for surveillance camera? Is it a strong or weak connection? Does it have a positive effect (increasing it) or a negative effect (decreasing it)? How strong is this effect?,I'd say they go hand-in-hand. I'd say law enforcement ought to be a hundred percent behind supporting civilian cameras and civilians shoot once the safety of it.
19,How would you describe the relationship between Crime and Support for surveillance camera? Is it a strong or weak connection? Does it have a positive effect (increasing it) or a negative effect (decreasing it)? How strong is this effect?,"I'd say if the crime rate goes up just a little, then the support for surveillance cameras is going to go up a whole lot."
20,"Is the effect of Public areas on Support for surveillance camera immediate, or does it take time to develop? Does it have a positive effect (increasing it) or a negative effect (decreasing it)? How strong is this effect?","Yeah, I think if the public decides to support it, they've all decided almost immediately. I think that's going to happen quick."
21,"Does Immediate Change have a positive or negative effect on Support for surveillance camera, and how significant is this effect? Does it have a positive effect (increasing it) or a negative effect (decreasing it)? How strong is this effect?","I think immediate change is needed, but I don't think it'll have immediate effect. But it will be positive."
22,"Does Saving lives have a positive or negative effect on Support for surveillance camera, and how significant is this effect? Does it have a positive effect (increasing it) or a negative effect (decreasing it)? How strong is this effect?","If they could save one life and prove they did it with a camera, then cameras would be supported 100%."
23,"Is the effect of Noticeable changes in support for surveillance cameras on Support for surveillance camera immediate, or does it take time to develop? Does it have a positive effect (increasing it) or a negative effect (decreasing it)? How strong is this effect?","Yeah, those changes make a huge increase in the support for surveillance."
24,"Is the effect of Negative Effect on Support for surveillance camera immediate, or does it take time to develop? Does it have a positive effect (increasing it) or a negative effect (decreasing it)? How strong is this effect?",It could be.
