6,Excellent! We're now ready to begin the interview about urban zoning policies. Take your time with each response and provide as much detail as you'd like. Let's start with our first question.,OK.
7,To what extent do you support or oppose upzoning policies that allow for higher density housing in traditionally single-family neighborhoods? Please explain your reasoning.,"I am about 80% sure that it is a good decision because it will create more housing, affordable housing for everybody and I think it is a better use of space also."
8,"What do you think are the most significant impacts, positive or negative, of increasing housing density in residential neighborhoods?","It will let middle-income people to afford houses because right now only people who earn more than $200,000 are able to afford a house and pay a mortgage. So this affordable housing will be good for middle and low-income people."
9,How do you think upzoning policies might affect housing affordability in urban areas?,"Upzoning is about making more houses in a pleasing manner that does not alter the existing community character. So with that, if it is planned well, it can be, the space can be better used with a good design. And in that way, a lot more people can benefit from upholding a house."
10,What impact do you believe increased housing density might have on neighborhood character and quality of life?,"I know it has its pros and cons, but for the better of the whole community, I think we can understand that a lot more housing needs to be developed in order for people to be able to live a comfortable life. With the existing number of houses, it causes many people to pay a huge rent and it does not do anything for the community."
11,How do you think upzoning might affect transportation systems and traffic congestion in cities?,"In this, I definitely agree, subzoning will bring a lot more people and it will definitely prove to be a challenge for the transportation system and create a traffic congestion. But with the right laws, I think it can be managed."
12,What role do you believe local government should play in regulating housing development and density?,"I think the local government should support up-zoning to create more housing for middle-income people. I believe we can all agree to have more housing so we don't have to pay so much rent, especially in California. Many people are moving away from the state because they are not able to afford housing here."
13,How might environmental concerns factor into decisions about urban density and zoning?,"Environmental concerns are definitely something to think about when making for the urban density. I know it can be a difficult, it can seem like a difficult task, but I'm sure with the right laws we can make the best use for environmental laws."
14,"What economic effects, both positive and negative, might result from changing zoning laws to allow more multi-family housing?","I know increased housing will create economic growth and many jobs will be created. Because of the housing, the local government will get more property tax and revenue and it will also create economic diversity."
15,How do you think the interests of current residents versus future residents should be balanced when making zoning decisions?,Current residents may not like it when the property values go down because of affordable housing and it will also create a stress on the water and sewage and even public transportation.
16,What role do you think social equity and access to opportunity play in discussions about zoning and housing policy?,"It can create diverse residents and more job opportunities. So, social equity will bring more fair and inclusive cities."
17,"Does Creation of more housing have a positive or negative effect on Support for Upzoning, and how significant is this effect? Does it have a positive effect (increasing it) or a negative effect (decreasing it)? How strong is this effect?","It can potentially have both positive and negative effects. Ultimately, it is a personal choice, but I feel affordable housing to a certain percentage is definitely beneficial for the whole community as a whole."
18,What causes changes in Support for Upzoning? Are these influences strong or weak?,People who live in upscale residential cities or areas might not like for affordable housing to be included in their zone because it kind of dilutes the community and social status. So I don't think it would be a welcome idea for them.
19,How confident are you that changes in Middle-Income People lead to changes in Support for Upzoning? Does it have a positive effect (increasing it) or a negative effect (decreasing it)? How strong is this effect?,"I strongly believe affordable housing should be there to a certain extent, not completely. But I definitely support upzoning to a certain percentage. I think it will have a positive effect. But there has to be a limit to how much we can upzone."
20,"Would small changes in Space Utilization lead to noticeable changes in Support for Upzoning, or would it take larger shifts? Does it have a positive effect (increasing it) or a negative effect (decreasing it)?

21,"Would small changes in Increased population lead to noticeable changes in Support for Upzoning, or would it take larger shifts? Does it have a positive effect (increasing it) or a negative effect (decreasing it)? How strong is this effect?","Again, small changes will not have that much of a noticeable difference in the support for upzoning. I think it needs to be a huge shift in order to really have a negative effect."
