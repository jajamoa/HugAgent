6,Excellent! We're now ready to begin the interview about urban zoning policies. Take your time with each response and provide as much detail as you'd like. Let's start with our first question.,Let's do it.
7,To what extent do you support or oppose upzoning policies that allow for higher density housing in traditionally single-family neighborhoods? Please explain your reasoning.,I'd have to say that I am somewhat in favor of it because we're currently experiencing a housing crisis and people need homes.
8,"What do you think are the most significant impacts, positive or negative, of increasing housing density in residential neighborhoods?",The most significant impact would be that there'd be more affordable housing for people who are in need of homes.
9,How do you think upzoning policies might affect housing affordability in urban areas?,I'd like to think that it would make homes in urban areas more affordable.
10,What impact do you believe increased housing density might have on neighborhood character and quality of life?,"I think it could be good for the neighborhood and the character of the neighborhood. I think that having more people will make the neighborhood more lively, for instance."
11,How do you think upzoning might affect transportation systems and traffic congestion in cities?,"I think it would actually hurt transportation quite a bit, at least until the services can accommodate the increased number of people."
12,What role do you believe local government should play in regulating housing development and density?,"I think local government has to make sure that the different services such as transportation services, such as public schools, are going to be able to accommodate the influx of new people in the neighborhood because of the different housing opportunities."
13,How might environmental concerns factor into decisions about urban density and zoning?,"To be quite honest, I think it would probably be quite bad for the environment. Having more people in a smaller congested area can't be good for the environment, but I think that the need for homes and the need for people to have affordable homes is a little more pressing than the current environmental concerns."
14,"What economic effects, both positive and negative, might result from changing zoning laws to allow more multi-family housing?",I think it would be good for local businesses.
15,How do you think the interests of current residents versus future residents should be balanced when making zoning decisions?,I think making any kind of major change to a place where people have been used to living has to be approached with caution because people generally don't like change and you really have to take that into account when making decisions that people have little to no say in.
16,What role do you think social equity and access to opportunity play in discussions about zoning and housing policy?,"I think one of the biggest issues facing people facing economic issues or equity issues is having access to affordable homes. You can't, or rather, people in general can't not have a home to live in. It's of the utmost importance to have any kind of opportunity in life. The most important thing is to have a place that you can live."
17,How would you describe the relationship between Upzoning policies and Support for Upzoning? Is it a strong or weak connection? Does it have a positive effect (increasing it) or a negative effect (decreasing it)? How strong is this effect?,"I think that the policies can positively affect support for upzoning if it seems like the rules are fair for everybody involved. Like I said before, having little to no say in the decision ultimately will make people feel uneasy about these kinds of changes. I think that some compromises will have to be made because the last thing you want is any kind of public protest or anything like that."
18,"What factors do you think influence Support for Upzoning, and how strong is their impact? Please also indicate if these influences are positive (increasing) or negative (decreasing).","For me personally, I think that one of the biggest factors that influences support for upzoning is the fact that it'll be good for local businesses. And if that's conveyed to the community in a clear and concise manner, it's pretty hard to make a case against it."
19,"Does Affordable Housing have a positive or negative effect on Support for Upzoning, and how significant is this effect? Does it have a positive effect (increasing it) or a negative effect (decreasing it)? How strong is this effect?","I believe it has a huge positive effect. As I said earlier, people need homes to live in. With homes being so unaffordable for most people, having access to more affordable living only increases support for upzoning."
20,"Does Housing affordability have a positive or negative effect on Support for Upzoning, and how significant is this effect? Does it have a positive effect (increasing it) or a negative effect (decreasing it)? How strong is this effect?","Housing affordability absolutely has a positive effect on support for upzoning. As I said earlier, having access to affordable living is the most important thing that one can have. In order to have any kind of access to opportunity, one must be able to have a place to live."
21,"Does Neighborhood character have a positive or negative effect on Support for Upzoning, and how significant is this effect? Does it have a positive effect (increasing it) or a negative effect (decreasing it)? How strong is this effect?","I think for some people it has a negative impact. Perhaps somebody who's lived in a neighborhood for a long time, many, many years, might be averse to the change, might be averse to the fact that there'll be more people there, services will be more congested. But such is also the nature of progress."
22,"Would small changes in Increased population density lead to noticeable changes in Support for Upzoning, or would it take larger shifts? Does it have a positive effect (increasing it) or a negative effect (decreasing it)? How strong is this effect?","Small changes in increased population shouldn't have a noticeable effect on support for upzoning. Larger shifts, however, I do believe would have a negative effect."
23,"Would small changes in Transportation services lead to noticeable changes in Support for Upzoning, or would it take larger shifts? Does it have a positive effect (increasing it) or a negative effect (decreasing it)? How strong is this effect?","Small changes in transportation services shouldn't have much of an effect. Larger changes, however, might start seeing opposition for upzoning. If it comes down to people not having access to the transportation services when they're needed, people are going to naturally be upset about that."
24,"Does Affordable housing needs have a positive or negative effect on Support for Upzoning, and how significant is this effect? Does it have a positive effect (increasing it) or a negative effect (decreasing it)? How strong is this effect?",I believe affordable housing needs has a very positive effect on support for upzoning. Many people today are struggling to find affordable housing. People need homes to live in. It's as simple as that.
25,How would you describe the relationship between Caution in making changes and Support for Upzoning? Is it a strong or weak connection? Does it have a positive effect (increasing it) or a negative effect (decreasing it)? How strong is this effect?,I think the matter has to be handled with caution. The people who are already living in these neighborhoods should have some degree of say when it comes to huge changes like this. It's important to make sure that these people are clearly informed about the positives and the negatives of how upzoning is going to affect their community. A lack of communication will lead to negative feelings over these upzoning changes.
26,"Would small changes in Access to Opportunity lead to noticeable changes in Support for Upzoning, or would it take larger shifts? Does it have a positive effect (increasing it) or a negative effect (decreasing it)? How strong is this effect?",I believe access to opportunity will have positive effects on support for upzoning. I can't see any reason why they wouldn't.
27,"What might lead to increases or decreases in Housing crisis, and how significant are these effects? Please also indicate if these influences are positive (increasing) or negative (decreasing).",I believe that these upzoning changes will have a positive effect on the housing crisis. More affordable homes for people looking for them will prove the benefits of upzoning. I see no reason why it wouldn't positively affect the crisis.
28,"Is the effect of Resistance to change on Support for Upzoning immediate, or does it take time to develop? Does it have a positive effect (increasing it) or a negative effect (decreasing it)? How strong is this effect?","I think resistance to the change of support is always going to be immediate. Naturally, it's going to take some time for people to lighten up and see the positives of upzoning. How long that may take depends on how strong of an influence the upzoning benefits are having."
29,How confident are you that changes in Opposition to Upzoning lead to changes in Support for Upzoning? Does it have a positive effect (increasing it) or a negative effect (decreasing it)? How strong is this effect?,"As more and more people see the positives of upzoning and the good that it brings to the community, you'll start to see more and more support for upzoning. Even the most staunch offenders, or rather, the most rather staunch opposers, can't deny that having more affordable housing is a good thing. That having more affordable house opportunities for people, as well as local businesses benefiting from these changes, they can't deny upzoning is a good thing."
30,"Is the effect of Access to Transportation Services on Support for Upzoning immediate, or does it take time to develop? Does it have a positive effect (increasing it) or a negative effect (decreasing it)? How strong is this effect?",The effects of access on transportation services will take some time to develop as more and more people require these services. It's going to start to have a sizable effect on the services themselves. It's important that these transportation services have the ability to accommodate these up-selling changes.
31,How confident are you that changes in Community involvement lead to changes in Support for Upzoning? Does it have a positive effect (increasing it) or a negative effect (decreasing it)? How strong is this effect?,"As I stated earlier, communicating clearly to the communities affected by upzoning what the positives are and what the negatives are will be the biggest determining factor in whether people support or oppose these changes. A lack of communication will undoubtedly lead to opposition, very strong opposition."
