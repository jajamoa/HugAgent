Question Number,Question,Answer
1,To what extent do you support or oppose universal healthcare policies that provide government-funded healthcare coverage for all citizens? Please explain your reasoning.,"Overall, I support universal health care policies. People need to have access to health care in times of need, in times of sickness, and poor health."
2,"What do you think are the most significant impacts, positive or negative, of implementing a universal healthcare system?","The most significant impact would be that people have access to healthcare, obviously. I believe that's a positive outcome. The most significant negative impact that I can think of would be that the system wouldn't be able to accommodate everyone's medical needs."
3,How do you think universal healthcare policies might affect healthcare quality and accessibility?,"For those that can't afford it, it'll positively affect them since this was a service that they didn't have access to previously. However, it may hurt accessibility due to an increased number of care required, thus leading to less availability."
4,What impact do you believe a universal healthcare system might have on medical innovation and research?,"I'd like to think that it would have a positive effect on innovation or research simply for the fact that more people can be treated. As such, this can be an opportunity to test out new medicines and technologies."
5,How do you think universal healthcare might affect the economic burden on individuals and families?,"That depends on the families. If it's a family who previously didn't have access to healthcare, it'll only positively affect them, since now they'll have the ability to get proper care. It may negatively affect those who weren't previously in need of universal healthcare to begin with. And what I mean by that is higher taxes, for instance."
6,What role do you believe government should play in healthcare delivery and financing?,I believe that the government has a responsibility to make sure that these healthcare services are always up and running and able to accommodate as many people as humanly possible who are in need of care.
7,How might healthcare provider concerns factor into decisions about universal healthcare implementation?,Healthcare providers most likely won't enjoy these changes too much if they were to be implemented. Now they'll be more on their plates and they are already having a tough time keeping up with the current volume of healthcare needs as it is.
8,"What economic effects, both positive and negative, might result from transitioning to a universal healthcare system?","I'd like to think that it would have a positive effect economically overall since people have less to worry about in regards to their health care needs. This allows for them to have the ability to spend their hard-earned money on other things that they need, outside of health care, such as the cost of living, food, education."
9,How do you think the interests of taxpayers versus healthcare consumers should be balanced when making healthcare policy?,"I think it's important for those taxpayers to not have to deal with the brunt of the cost. As I said before, those who weren't in need of universal healthcare stand to lose in this situation on account of having to pay more taxes. Now those who are in need of these kinds of changes will only stand to benefit, and it's important to find the right medium between these two groups of people."
10,What role do you think social equity and access to care play in discussions about healthcare policy?,I believe that access to care plays the biggest role in discussions about health care policy. The fact that there are many people who don't have access to health care leads to this issue being discussed in the first place.
11,How would you describe the relationship between Access to healthcare and Support for universal healthcare? Is it a strong or weak connection? Does it have a positive effect (increasing it) or a negative effect (decreasing it)? How strong is this effect?,"I believe it's a very strong connection. If there wasn't such a need for access to health care, then there wouldn't be such a public outcry in favor of universal health care. It's the lack of access to health care that has caused the issue. And for many, the solution to this problem is universal health care. It has a huge effect."
12,"What factors affect Support for universal healthcare, and which ones have the strongest influence? Please also indicate if these influences are positive (increasing) or negative (decreasing).","The biggest factors which affect support for universal healthcare are, as previously discussed, access to healthcare, the cost of healthcare, the fact that many people can't afford even the most basic forms of healthcare. If there wasn't such a lack of access to begin with, we wouldn't see such a rousing support for the idea of universal healthcare. These influences very positively affect support for universal healthcare."
13,"Would small changes in Healthcare accessibility lead to noticeable changes in Support for universal healthcare, or would it take larger shifts? Does it have a positive effect (increasing it) or a negative effect (decreasing it)? How strong is this effect?","I think small changes would positively affect support for universal health care, however, larger shifts will have an even greater effect. Now whether that's positive or negative depends on whether or not the system can keep up with the needs of those who are in need of care."
14,"Is the effect of Increased patient access on Support for universal healthcare immediate, or does it take time to develop? Does it have a positive effect (increasing it) or a negative effect (decreasing it)? How strong is this effect?","I believe the effect of increased patient access is immediate. Once people who are in need of healthcare are able to take advantage of these services, you're going to see an instant result, a positive one, in that people will finally have the ability to get the proper care they need."
15,"Does Negative impact on those not needing universal healthcare have a positive or negative effect on Support for universal healthcare, and how significant is this effect? Does it have a positive effect (increasing it) or a negative effect (decreasing it)? How strong is this effect?","I believe it has a negative impact on those who don't need universal health care, as previously discussed. If you're a family who wasn't financially struggling, who wasn't experiencing a lack of access to health care, now your taxes will be higher, and essentially, you're going to be responsible for paying for someone else's health care that you don't need."
16,"Is the effect of Resistance to change on Support for universal healthcare immediate, or does it take time to develop? Does it have a positive effect (increasing it) or a negative effect (decreasing it)? How strong is this effect?","I believe the effect of resistance will take lots of time to develop. The fact that we still don't have universal health care in this country is proof of that. We may never, at this rate, see overwhelming support policy-wise for universal health care."
17,How confident are you that changes in Reduced financial stress lead to changes in Support for universal healthcare? Does it have a positive effect (increasing it) or a negative effect (decreasing it)? How strong is this effect?,"100% confident, less financial stress about health care means less stress overall, and the ability to have money to spend on other necessities such as food, education, entertainment, For those who are in need of universal health care, the results will only be positive, financially speaking."
18,"Is the effect of Finding the right medium on Support for universal healthcare immediate, or does it take time to develop? Does it have a positive effect (increasing it) or a negative effect (decreasing it)? How strong is this effect?","I believe that finding the right medium on support will take some time. As we discussed earlier, despite the idea of universal healthcare being very positive to the average Joe, those who are in charge of enacting policy do not seem to agree. And there needs to be a gathering of the minds in order to find the right medium, or else we can never see it implemented, simply put."
19,How would you describe the relationship between Healthcare policy and Support for universal healthcare? Is it a strong or weak connection? Does it have a positive effect (increasing it) or a negative effect (decreasing it)? How strong is this effect?,"I would say that the relationship between healthcare policy and support for universal healthcare is one that is very diametrically opposed. It's been an ongoing debate for years, and there seems to be no happy medium in sight."
20,How confident are you that changes in Strong Connection lead to changes in Support for universal healthcare? Does it have a positive effect (increasing it) or a negative effect (decreasing it)? How strong is this effect?,I believe that these changes have a positive effect on support for health care and I believe it's a strong effect. I have no strong personal feeling on the matter.
21,"Is the effect of Public Outcry for Universal Healthcare on Support for universal healthcare immediate, or does it take time to develop? Does it have a positive effect (increasing it) or a negative effect (decreasing it)? How strong is this effect?","The effect of public outcry for universal healthcare on support has not only already taken a long time to develop, but still seems to require more time. As for whether it's a positive or negative effect, it seems to be negative, because after all this time and after all these years, we still don't have policy enacting universal healthcare. It's almost as if the higher the public outcry, the louder the public outcry, the less likely legislation will be passed to support universal healthcare."
22,How would you describe the relationship between Cost of healthcare and Support for universal healthcare? Is it a strong or weak connection? Does it have a positive effect (increasing it) or a negative effect (decreasing it)? How strong is this effect?,"The cost of healthcare is, in my opinion, the biggest factor in support for universal healthcare. People simply can't afford the care that they need. The connection is very strong. If the cost of healthcare wasn't so crippling to most people, we wouldn't see such an outcry of support for universal healthcare in the first place."
23,"What might lead to increases or decreases in Universal healthcare, and how significant are these effects? Please also indicate if these influences are positive (increasing) or negative (decreasing).","It all comes down to policy. If the institutions we have available to us are able to accommodate the health care needs of the general public, no significant changes should have to be made. If there's a lack of access, even when cost isn't a factor, then we have a problem and big changes will be necessary."
24,"Would small changes in Positive effect on support for universal healthcare lead to noticeable changes in Support for universal healthcare, or would it take larger shifts? Does it have a positive effect (increasing it) or a negative effect (decreasing it)? How strong is this effect?","I think for the general public, it would take larger shifts. For the average Joe, a small shift would suffice. Having access to healthcare that he or she might not have had access to before will undoubtedly have a positive effect on support for universal healthcare. The larger shifts are what's going to affect the court of public opinion."
25,"Would small changes in Immediate Effect lead to noticeable changes in Support for universal healthcare, or would it take larger shifts? Does it have a positive effect (increasing it) or a negative effect (decreasing it)? How strong is this effect?","I don't believe that small changes in immediate effect would really lead to any noticeable change in support. It would take a larger shift. Whether it has a positive or negative effect depends on what the changes are in the first place. If the changes allow for more access to health care, then they should undoubtedly have a positive effect."
26,"What do you think are the main causes of Universal healthcare system, and how certain are you about these relationships? Please also indicate if these influences are positive (increasing) or negative (decreasing).","I believe the main cause of a universal healthcare system is, simply put, a form of government is responsible for its people. Without the people, there is no government. It's important for these people, who the government can't function without, have access to healthcare, affordable healthcare. It's the lack of affordable healthcare that's led to the need of a universal healthcare system to begin with. These influences are negative, but for a positive reason."
27,How confident are you that changes in Positive financial impact lead to changes in Support for universal healthcare? Does it have a positive effect (increasing it) or a negative effect (decreasing it)? How strong is this effect?,"I am 100% confident that financial positive impact will only lead to more support for universal health care. People having extra money for the things that they need outside of health care will undoubtedly lead people to have a higher quality of life, and that is a strong effect, a massive effect."
