This helps us capture your thinking process more thoroughly.",I don't see the text mode.
6,Excellent! We're now ready to begin the interview about urban zoning policies. Take your time with each response and provide as much detail as you'd like. Let's start with our first question.,"Okay, what is the first question?"
7,To what extent do you support or oppose upzoning policies that allow for higher density housing in traditionally single-family neighborhoods? Please explain your reasoning.,"I don't support the policy at all because we have a small town and there's a lot of people already. We are in a college town, usually when students come in, we have like 30 or 40% more traffic at least or more."
8,"What do you think are the most significant impacts, positive or negative, of increasing housing density in residential neighborhoods?","The positive probably behind more benefits or more income for the restaurants and retails. Negative would be traffic, parking, housing. That's a lot of problems. Because if we only increase the housing without parking, without public transportation, without sewage system, all those things taken into consideration, then it would create a problem for all of us."
9,How do you think upzoning policies might affect housing affordability in urban areas?,"The housing, rental, whatever, is so high now, I don't think a lot of people can afford it. So even like 10%, 30%, it's still not gonna cut it. We have some tall buildings only built in the last five, 10 years. And we still empty spaces there. And downtown, we still have empty retail spaces for rent. So taller building doesn't mean it's affordable. When you mean affordable, a lot of people cannot afford it, actually."
10,What impact do you believe increased housing density might have on neighborhood character and quality of life?,"dense area means more traffic, more, you know, problems, social problems, like noise, you know, more, don't know, maybe crime, could it be? It's, you know, inescapable. So we have a lot of problems already, and you just add more if we have more dense neighborhood."
11,How do you think upzoning might affect transportation systems and traffic congestion in cities?,"Our public transportation is there, but it's not perfect, and mostly just for students. And if you put more dense area building and then no parking, no public transportation, also no other help, then it definitely would create a lot of traffic and congestion. Nowadays, we have more traffic congestion because a lot of renovation or reconstruction on the road."
12,What role do you believe local government should play in regulating housing development and density?,"The local government should do it slowly, just test it out, maybe one or two, see how it goes. Because what we have seen is it's not affordable for a lot of people because still empty spaces in houses, buildings that built last 10 years. If you suddenly put in like 7, 8, 10 tall buildings, we don't really know what the impact is. You only benefit the builders and the local didn't really get a lot because you only have like 10, 15 affordable in each 10 buildings, then it's not a lot. And that's called affordable, it means maybe 10, 20% less, but still very, very expensive nowadays."
13,How might environmental concerns factor into decisions about urban density and zoning?,"Well, definitely going to be more noise, probably going to be more garbage and sewage problem. Those utility monthly costs are going to go up and the rest of us going to help pay for it."
14,"What economic effects, both positive and negative, might result from changing zoning laws to allow more multi-family housing?","More people means more profits for retails, shops. You know, it's good for them, but it's not good for the rest of the city because all the locals are gonna get a lot of noise and we pay more for our utility bills. We probably have to pay more, you know, to maintain the road or canals. You know, the impact we don't know yet and we may have to pay to fix it later on."
15,How do you think the interests of current residents versus future residents should be balanced when making zoning decisions?,"And I don't know why we have to put all the dense building into the existing residential area. I think the government or the local government or state government should think if there is an open space, we can put those tall buildings there and then just test it out. Maybe build a public transportation there from the area into downtown and see how it goes instead of just put everything, changing everything in the existing city fabric."
16,What role do you think social equity and access to opportunity play in discussions about zoning and housing policy?,"I don't think we have much to say about it, except for like, you know, we can voice, but usually we downplay that as a citizen, because all the builders, you know, they somehow they convince, you know, the people in the city, county, and it's a good idea. But those people, I think it's pretty short sighted, and they're only thinking about like, for, you know, 30%, you know, 15%, so-called affordable housing, and it's not a lot. So pretty much it's, you know, like, this is a huge opportunity for builders to benefit from it. And the rest of us, we have to help pay for it, actually. And for that, you know, 15%."
17,"Would small changes in Higher density housing lead to noticeable changes in Support for Upzoning, or would it take larger shifts? Does it have a positive effect (increasing it) or a negative effect (decreasing it)? How strong is this effect?","I think definitely would help for the support, you know, because, you know, we're human, we thought about that, you know, we really want to help, but not to the extent that you impact us negatively in our own life. We want to help. So if we do it slowly, then we, at least, you know, any big, any impact, at least, you know, as a minimize it to the rest of us, and we can think something else. That's an example already. You know, like we already have like 70, those, you know, high density buildings, building or being built. And now suddenly another mayor or something said, oh, we want to petition for another, you know, thing on the ballot in November, because we want to do it another way. And we want to get, you know, some tax, you know, income, and then we want to, you know, try this, you know, other way to do it. So see, people seeing it is not going to cut it. People are thinking, you know, something else, while those buildings still being built, 708 still being built."
18,"What factors affect Support for Upzoning, and which ones have the strongest influence? Please also indicate if these influences are positive (increasing) or negative (decreasing).","If we get it under control and better planning and have some tryouts, maybe build one or two dance buildings first and see how it goes and do it slowly, then I think a lot of us would support it. If suddenly you put in 10 tall, dense buildings, then nobody knows the impact and that's scary because once you get there, you can't reverse it."
19,How confident are you that changes in Traffic congestion lead to changes in Support for Upzoning? Does it have a positive effect (increasing it) or a negative effect (decreasing it)? How strong is this effect?,"Change in traffic congestion, as long as there are more people, there's no way you can avoid it. So this is not going to help. It's definitely facts there. So definitely it's negative."
20,"Does Housing Affordability have a positive or negative effect on Support for Upzoning, and how significant is this effect? Does it have a positive effect (increasing it) or a negative effect (decreasing it)? How strong is this effect?","Yes, housing affordability is really affordable, but I don't think it's affordable for a lot of people. Even those so-called affordable units, they're only like, who knows, 20, 25% less. But nowadays, the rent is so high in the area I live, even 20% off is still very, very high."
21,How would you describe the relationship between Tall Buildings and Support for Upzoning? Is it a strong or weak connection? Does it have a positive effect (increasing it) or a negative effect (decreasing it)? How strong is this effect?,"Yes, tall buildings and support for up-zoning, people don't like, people just don't like tall buildings because it totally changes the city fabric, so it's not a good thing."
22,"Would small changes in Noise lead to noticeable changes in Support for Upzoning, or would it take larger shifts? Does it have a positive effect (increasing it) or a negative effect (decreasing it)? How strong is this effect?","Minimizing noise definitely help, but it's not a big one so far. But we don't know how that actually happened. I mean, we don't know how that would be. We only have that negative. It could be really bad, because I've been in a big city and it's really, really noisy and it's really, really bad."
23,"Is the effect of Public transportation on Support for Upzoning immediate, or does it take time to develop? Does it have a positive effect (increasing it) or a negative effect (decreasing it)? How strong is this effect?","Better public transportation definitely helps, positively, and you know, it could be done very quickly if the city can plan for it, but that would, you know, connect it to the noise, it will increase a lot of noise because bus could be noisy, yeah, and pollution, everything."
24,"Would small changes in Gradual Approach lead to noticeable changes in Support for Upzoning, or would it take larger shifts? Does it have a positive effect (increasing it) or a negative effect (decreasing it)? How strong is this effect?","Something like that was actually happening here in our neighbor. We really support the upzoning, but the thing is it happened so quickly. A lot of us didn't support it, we wanted to slow it down, and if we do it slowly and have a better plan and under control, then we'll definitely go for it."
25,"Is the effect of Affordable Housing on Support for Upzoning immediate, or does it take time to develop? Does it have a positive effect (increasing it) or a negative effect (decreasing it)? How strong is this effect?","Oh. It would take a year or so, not immediately. When we say immediately, it means like two year time. We have some built already here in our area, and we only see some very limited units. Some people move in. We saw light, but most of them still empty. Downstairs, the retail units are empty. So, yeah."
26,"Would small changes in Impact Assessment lead to noticeable changes in Support for Upzoning, or would it take larger shifts? Does it have a positive effect (increasing it) or a negative effect (decreasing it)? How strong is this effect?","Yes, small change in impact assessment, need to know some changes in support for observing, definitely, because, and other that we pretty much have some idea which direction or how big the impact is. And do we need to think about some other way to do it? Because once you put in those turbulence, there's no way to reverse it."
27,How would you describe the relationship between Builders' Profits and Support for Upzoning? Is it a strong or weak connection? Does it have a positive effect (increasing it) or a negative effect (decreasing it)? How strong is this effect?,"Builders, and not really, no, I think it's really with connection, because that 20% is not going to be really affordable for a lot of people still, because our area is so expensive. So we really need to think something else, not for the builders to do this, because 80% those profit will go to them, even the 20% is still probably profit for them in the long term, because it's so expensive nowadays. The government, the local government has to do something differently. The builders are not going to help us."
28,How would you describe the relationship between Current Housing Market and Support for Upzoning? Is it a strong or weak connection? Does it have a positive effect (increasing it) or a negative effect (decreasing it)? How strong is this effect?,"Current housing market is very strong and high and so that's why a lot of people for support for upzoning, but the thing is they don't know the impact to the city, fabric, a lot of problems created without well-planning or under control tested. So at least so far we've seen with the builders cutting a lot of corners and things like that, but it's not going to benefit a lot of people and it's very minimized. So we need to think of something else."
29,How would you describe the relationship between Noise pollution and Support for Upzoning? Is it a strong or weak connection? Does it have a positive effect (increasing it) or a negative effect (decreasing it)? How strong is this effect?,"I live in an area, you know, we're really concerned about the environmental impact. So definitely, noise pollution would be a key, you know, factor we'll consider. And so for us, it's a strong connection. But I guess a lot of people can't think clearly when it comes to like, you put things like into one, two, three places and the noise connection part down to like fifth position. But still, when everything settles down and people maybe suddenly realize that, oh, my God, this is too much noise, too late."
30,"Would small changes in Retail and shop profits lead to noticeable changes in Support for Upzoning, or would it take larger shifts? Does it have a positive effect (increasing it) or a negative effect (decreasing it)? How strong is this effect?","Luckily, the retail shops here, it's pretty much run by the locals, so they have the same concern and they don't think, you know, the profits at the bar, you know, more dense building would be good for them. They are doing okay. They don't need more money than, you know, they'd have to if the negative impact is more than they would for the city."
31,How would you describe the relationship between Balancing current residents' interests and Support for Upzoning? Is it a strong or weak connection? Does it have a positive effect (increasing it) or a negative effect (decreasing it)? How strong is this effect?,"There is no doubt the current residents' interest is definitely, you know, support for upzoning, but we want it to be under control and take it slowly and have well-planned instead of like a rush."
32,How would you describe the relationship between Access to Opportunity and Support for Upzoning? Is it a strong or weak connection? Does it have a positive effect (increasing it) or a negative effect (decreasing it)? How strong is this effect?,"Yeah, access to opportunity definitely for the builders. So they would, you know, campaign for any way, any means to get support for that. But you know, people don't see it, the negative thing, it just, unfortunately, the high rent right now, high living standard. And a lot of people just, oh, this is a good idea. And then they didn't really know, hey, actually, you know, once this bill is not that affordable for them."
33,"What might lead to increases or decreases in Upzoning policies, and how significant are these effects? Please also indicate if these influences are positive (increasing) or negative (decreasing).","Lacking of housing is going to increase for upzoning policy, we like it or not, so that means, you know, the population increase would lead to that. So, don't know, negative or positive, because it's negative for the rest of us, it's positive for the future generation, but for the environment, for the city fabric, for all the problems created for the next generation they have to face, it's not a good thing. Thank you."
