More money can go towards local businesses or generally other things. Like it would be great for consumerism because you could actually afford to buy yourself little luxuries and not have to pay off hospital bills every month. Um, but aside from that, even facing the negative economic effects, uh, okay. More taxes. Well, a significant amount of taxes here in the U S already goes towards funding the military industrial complex, which is a huge waste. This is, it's a significant amount.

However, the government can be very corrupt and can find a way to do terrible things with absolutely anything they get their hands on, depending on the administration.

I don't know what their, like I said, I have no idea what their motivations would be. I'm not a healthcare provider. I don't personally know any healthcare providers who could give me their say about this. So if their motivations are negative, then it would probably skew things negatively. If their motivations are positive, it would probably skew things positively. Although I don't think it would have a massive effect on everything. People think very selfishly in a way in terms of they're going to think about what's best for themselves and the people that they care about, which isn't entirely selfish, but I think you know what I mean there.

For people who are worried about their finances and taxpayer dollars and are very selfish in that aspect, then yeah, it would have a negative impact.

More money can go towards local businesses or generally other things.

However, the government can be very corrupt and can find a way to do terrible things with absolutely anything they get their hands on, depending on the administration.

I don't personally know any healthcare providers who could give me their say about this. So if their motivations are negative, then it would probably skew things negatively. If their motivations are positive, it would probably skew things positively. Although I don't think it would have a massive effect on everything. People think very selfishly in a way in terms of they're going to think about what's best for themselves and the people that they care about, which isn't entirely selfish, but I think you know what I mean there.

I don't personally know any healthcare providers who could give me their say about this. So if their motivations are negative, then it would probably skew things negatively.

But at that point, I think we just understand who deserves to become a doctor and who's just in it for money, who's not going to take care of their patients properly.

Um, so that would be a negative for most people. Positive, you know, maybe you wouldn't have to pay as much to survive. So on an individual basis, that's pretty great. More money can go towards local businesses or generally other things. Like it would be great for consumerism because you could actually afford to buy yourself little luxuries and not have to pay off hospital bills every month. Um, but aside from that, even facing the negative economic effects, uh, okay. More taxes. Well, a significant amount of taxes here in the U S already goes towards funding the military industrial complex, which is a huge waste. This is, it's a significant amount.

The rich shouldn't survive just because they're rich and the poor shouldn't have to suffer or be in debt or die just because they can't afford care.

If you have a lot of money, you can survive, you can afford to live. That's already an immediate thing that everybody knows.

That's definitely the biggest effect in one direction. Um, that has a big influence on lots of people who care about money more than human life. So that would be negative towards universal healthcare. I would say something positive for it would be believing that human life is equal and how much money you have doesn't have an effect on if you deserve to live or not.

I think if people didn't have to worry about paying to survive, they would prefer to have universal health care.

However, the government can be very corrupt and can find a way to do terrible things with absolutely anything they get their hands on, depending on the administration.

I don't know what their, like I said, I have no idea what their motivations would be. I'm not a healthcare provider. I don't personally know any healthcare providers who could give me their say about this. So if their motivations are negative, then it would probably skew things negatively. If their motivations are positive, it would probably skew things positively. Although I don't think it would have a massive effect on everything. People think very selfishly in a way in terms of they're going to think about what's best for themselves and the people that they care about, which isn't entirely selfish, but I think you know what I mean there.

It's kind of the same thing as do people who can't afford it or do people who are disabled have a right to survive? And you have to ask yourself morally the answer to that. For people who are worried about their finances and taxpayer dollars and are very selfish in that aspect, then yeah, it would have a negative impact. But I think that for people with morality and humanity who care about the sanctity of human life and understand that everyone deserves to live, whether they're born disabled or whether they become disabled or whether they are poor or whether they're anybody of any kind, if you are a human being, you have a right to live.

I don't personally know any healthcare providers who could give me their say about this. So if their motivations are negative, then it would probably skew things negatively. If their motivations are positive, it would probably skew things positively. Although I don't think it would have a massive effect on everything.

I don't fully understand this question."}, {"question_number": "12", "question": "How would you describe the relationship between Relief from financial worry and Support for universal healthcare? Is it a strong or weak connection? Does it have a positive effect (increasing it) or a negative effect (decreasing it)? How strong is this effect?", "answer": "an incredibly strong effect. I think if people didn't have to worry about paying to survive, they would prefer to have universal health care. It is a very strong connection because, you know, not having to pay hundreds of thousands of dollars for your cancer treatment is definitely a lot better than going completely bankrupt. I would say that it increases support, yes."}, {"question_number": "13", "question": "How would you describe the relationship between Government responsibility for healthcare and Support for universal healthcare? Is it a strong or weak connection? Does it have a positive effect (increasing it) or a negative effect (decreasing it)? How strong is this effect?", "answer": "I would say I guess this has a bit of an effect in both directions, because number one, yes, the government has a right to, or not the government has a right, the people have a right to have a government that takes care of them. However, the government can be very corrupt and can find a way to do terrible things with absolutely anything they get their hands on, depending on the administration. So I'm not sure if people would trust the government entirely. So it could be positive, it might be negative. However, the government definitely should be responsible, that's what I can say for certain."}, {"question_number": "14", "question": "How confident are you that changes in Healthcare provider motivations lead to changes in Support for universal healthcare? Does it have a positive effect (increasing it) or a negative effect (decreasing it)? How strong is this effect?", "answer": "Personally don't think it would have a really big effect. I don't know what their, like I said, I have no idea what their motivations would be. I'm not a healthcare provider. I don't personally know any healthcare providers who could give me their say about this. So if their motivations are negative, then it would probably skew things negatively. If their motivations are positive, it would probably skew things positively. Although I don't think it would have a massive effect on everything. People think very selfishly in a way in terms of they're going to think about what's best for themselves and the people that they care about, which isn't entirely selfish, but I think you know what I mean there. So yeah, not much of an effect, but I don't know if this is a positive or a negative thing because I don't know what their motivations would be."}, {"question_number": "15", "question": "How would you describe the relationship between Individual Financial Relief and Support for universal healthcare?

It's kind of the same thing as do people who can't afford it or do people who are disabled have a right to survive? And you have to ask yourself morally the answer to that. For people who are worried about their finances and taxpayer dollars and are very selfish in that aspect, then yeah, it would have a negative impact. But I think that for people with morality and humanity who care about the sanctity of human life and understand that everyone deserves to live, whether they're born disabled or whether they become disabled or whether they are poor or whether they're anybody of any kind, if you are a human being, you have a right to live.

Is it a strong or weak connection? Does it have a positive effect (increasing it) or a negative effect (decreasing it)?

Does it have a positive effect (increasing it) or a negative effect (decreasing it)? How strong is this effect?", "answer": "I mean, yes, if people had more access to care, then maybe they wouldn't be as worried about immediately having universal healthcare, but universal healthcare would lead to everybody having access to care. So I think that maybe potentially, once people realize how nice it is for everybody to have access to care and how it really doesn't affect them that much, perhaps more people would be in support of it. I would hope so, realizing that it benefits absolutely everybody."}, {"question_number": "20", "question": "How confident are you that changes in Universal Health Care lead to changes in Support for universal healthcare?

For instance, transportation to get to hospitals, hospitals and how well funded they are in poorer areas. Equality is something that takes a long time to develop fully. But universal healthcare will definitely help step in the right direction towards it.
