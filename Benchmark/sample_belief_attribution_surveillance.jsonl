Already law enforcement should be turning on their body cameras for things when they just don't. They turn it off and they commit crimes, things like that.

There's no way there's not going to be a bias added to this surveillance. It's going to be absolutely terrible. In the same way that there's more police surveillance in areas where there are poorer people or people of color, the same thing's going to happen with surveillance technology. There's no way it's not going to be prejudiced against people, absolutely none. I think it should have a significant effect on discussions about it.

I would say it has a positive effect and support and I would say not the strongest effect ever, but definitely a strong effect. Yeah, it would definitely help people feel like if something happens to them, they're more likely to get justice and might deter people.

I can see it immediately being something that people would be able to very easily mark as a sort of bias, some sort of discrimination. If things happened all at once, maybe it would actually be less obvious. I really can't imagine how it would go, and I think this completely depends on the area that you are in and the way that things are where you are. Like, it's completely dependent.

Maybe it'll make you feel safer just walking along the street. I think this falls into the exact same vein, like yes, public safety and crime deterrence fall hand in hand.

And it's not like every single person is consenting to being filmed every moment of their lives in the area that they're in. And even if you know it's there, like you can't opt out of it, you can't say yes or no, you just exist in those areas and don't have a choice. So I would say it's an immediate effect.

And of course, the wrong person might be absolutely convicted. Or for instance, they might see somebody, it might look dark. And of course, with stereotypes and with the way that this racist judicial system works, they'll be like, oh, oh, it might totally just be some white dude who looks dark in the image, you know? Or like some white dude who looks tanned. They'll be like, oh, it was a Latino or oh, it was a black man, you know? Something like that. And absolutely, it'll be used to profile. There's no way, it's going to be really bad. The grainy footage, it's not like we're gonna have HD cameras on every street. It's going to be grainy, especially at night.

I think it needs to be dismantled and rebuilt from the ground up to be an institution that is not prejudiced and violent and lawless. So I think that privacy advocates should absolutely be listened to far more because so far the people don't have power when it comes to fighting against law enforcement, speaking out against law enforcement. Already law enforcement should be turning on their body cameras for things when they just don't. They turn it off and they commit crimes, things like that.

There's no way there's not going to be a bias added to this surveillance. It's going to be absolutely terrible. In the same way that there's more police surveillance in areas where there are poorer people or people of color, the same thing's going to happen with surveillance technology. There's no way it's not going to be prejudiced against people, absolutely none. I think it should have a significant effect on discussions about it. I think it's going to be something incredibly contentious if that's what it gets down to, especially in this sort of political climate, but the reality is it's going to be used in nefarious ways. It's not going to be used equally."

I don't really think there's much of an in-between. Those are two extremes. Or at the very least, if you're not feeling like an extreme, black or white, you're in a gray area in the middle, it's you're gonna be uncomfortable with it, knowing that you're being watched at all times and that potentially something can be used against you. Or maybe if you have a stalker, especially someone who's in law enforcement, you might worry about what that'll do. Or if you have someone in law enforcement who has a vendetta against you, there are absolutely evil people in law enforcement. Not everybody, but very many. And that would absolutely be concerning. Privacy invasion, people are already paranoid with the intranets and how things can be tracked back to them and how they can be stalked or things like that. It's going to be so much worse with just cameras pointing at you everywhere. I would say it's a pretty strong connection and it has a very negative effect."

I can see it immediately being something that people would be able to very easily mark as a sort of bias, some sort of discrimination. If things happened all at once, maybe it would actually be less obvious. I really can't imagine how it would go, and I think this completely depends on the area that you are in and the way that things are where you are. Like, it's completely dependent.

There's no way, it's going to be really bad. The grainy footage, it's not like we're gonna have HD cameras on every street. It's going to be grainy, especially at night.

I kind of just see a negative effect in the terms of this is going to cost cities to keep going. It costs money to keep this going.

So I think that privacy advocates should absolutely be listened to far more because so far the people don't have power when it comes to fighting against law enforcement, speaking out against law enforcement. Already law enforcement should be turning on their body cameras for things when they just don't. They turn it off and they commit crimes, things like that. I think that we have to deal with law enforcement and how corrupt it is first before we even consider giving them any sort of extra leverage on innocent people who they are just destroying the communities of."

There's no way there's not going to be a bias added to this surveillance. It's going to be absolutely terrible. In the same way that there's more police surveillance in areas where there are poorer people or people of color, the same thing's going to happen with surveillance technology. There's no way it's not going to be prejudiced against people, absolutely none. I think it should have a significant effect on discussions about it. I think it's going to be something incredibly contentious if that's what it gets down to, especially in this sort of political climate, but the reality is it's going to be used in nefarious ways. It's not going to be used equally."

I don't really think there's much of an in-between. Those are two extremes. Or at the very least, if you're not feeling like an extreme, black or white, you're in a gray area in the middle, it's you're gonna be uncomfortable with it, knowing that you're being watched at all times and that potentially something can be used against you. Or maybe if you have a stalker, especially someone who's in law enforcement, you might worry about what that'll do. Or if you have someone in law enforcement who has a vendetta against you, there are absolutely evil people in law enforcement. Not everybody, but very many. And that would absolutely be concerning. Privacy invasion, people are already paranoid with the intranets and how things can be tracked back to them and how they can be stalked or things like that. It's going to be so much worse with just cameras pointing at you everywhere. I would say it's a pretty strong connection and it has a very negative effect."

I would say it has a positive effect and support and I would say not the strongest effect ever, but definitely a strong effect. Yeah, it would definitely help people feel like if something happens to them, they're more likely to get justice and might deter people.

I can see it immediately being something that people would be able to very easily mark as a sort of bias, some sort of discrimination. If things happened all at once, maybe it would actually be less obvious. I really can't imagine how it would go, and I think this completely depends on the area that you are in and the way that things are where you are. Like, it's completely dependent.

Maybe it'll make you feel safer just walking along the street. I think this falls into the exact same vein, like yes, public safety and crime deterrence fall hand in hand.

And it's not like every single person is consenting to being filmed every moment of their lives in the area that they're in. And even if you know it's there, like you can't opt out of it, you can't say yes or no, you just exist in those areas and don't have a choice. So I would say it's an immediate effect. I don't understand how it would take time to develop if the cameras are just there already. And of course it has a negative effect, a very strong effect. That's one of the biggest reasons that people would despise it or dislike it or not want it."

I mean, being weary of others is a pretty, I guess it's important to be weary of others. I think we should be weary of others even without surveillance cameras. I don't understand what this question is pointing to. I think it may be one of the questions that is like added because of one of the answers that I gave and I don't quite know how to answer it.

And back when it was also asked, is the effect of breach of privacy on support in the last few questions? So it's the exact same answer that I would give. I apologize for repeating that, but it's the same answer. A very negative effect because it's a breach of privacy and people can use that against you."

      "answer": "This question answers itself, small changes in negative economic impact. So I assume this would mean economic impact is getting worse. If negative economic impact is becoming more negative, it's going to have a negative effect. If small changes in negative economic impact means it's becoming less negative, then it will have a positive impact. This question answers itself, so it's kind of redundant."

      "answer": "Oh, for sure. If law enforcement were less corrupt and more trustworthy and had a better relationship with communities, then yes, definitely it would be easier for people to accept them as enforcing surveillance, which again is still a breach of privacy. But I think taking out the effects of a corrupt law enforcement is definitely a very positive impact, and it's a pretty strong effect because I think one of the biggest recoils is distrust for the police. So if that were definitely restructured and made better, if it were reformed, so to say, I think that that would be good for everybody, not even just in this effect, just altogether. So it would be a net positive if the laws of law enforcement were reformed, for sure."

      "answer": "I think this is based on one of the questions I was asked, which is, yeah, I would say this is law enforcement has a say in absolutely everything. They have more power and are completely lawless. It's like cops can get away with so many horrific things and the judicial system is not all that much better for the most part. I would say that if law enforcement has this kind of insane power, then of course there's an imbalance between them and just the general population, which is where privacy advocates would be, unless, A, it would be great if there were a privacy advocate in government or local governments. But aside from that, no, the general public do not have as much power as law enforcement. It's a very strong connection to it and has a very negative effect against surveillance."

Because yes, using something for a bad thing is bad. And I think most people would see it as bad. So I think that this is a question maybe the AI picked up on, but it answers itself right there."

      "question": "What do you think are the main causes of Privacy Invasion, and how certain are you about these relationships? Please also indicate if these influences are positive (increasing) or negative (decreasing).",
      "answer": "I mean, privacy invasion happens for very many reasons. It's political surveillance, potentially surveillance by law enforcement that feels scorned or even an individual that feels scorned. It can be stalking, obsession. There are a multitude of reasons, financial reasons, financial, personal, political. Those are the big three. And of course I'm certain about these relationships. They happen all the time. There's tons of privacy invasion over the internet constantly to begin with. There's always stalking. Things like this just make them significantly more dangerous. So it's like already pre-existing privacy invasion made so much easier for the offenders. And of course they're a very negative thing. I can't imagine privacy invasion would ever be a positive thing. And you can even argue in cases of like, oh, well they find criminals through that. Yeah, okay, well also regular people are hurt through that very significantly. So it's not for the greater good, not at all."

I don't understand how it would take time to develop if the cameras are just there already. And of course it has a negative effect, a very strong effect. That's one of the biggest reasons that people would despise it or dislike it or not want it."

I think it needs to be dismantled and rebuilt from the ground up to be an institution that is not prejudiced and violent and lawless. So I think that privacy advocates should absolutely be listened to far more because so far the people don't have power when it comes to fighting against law enforcement, speaking out against law enforcement. Already law enforcement should be turning on their body cameras for things when they just don't. They turn it off and they commit crimes, things like that.

There's no way there's not going to be a bias added to this surveillance. It's going to be absolutely terrible. In the same way that there's more police surveillance in areas where there are poorer people or people of color, the same thing's going to happen with surveillance technology. There's no way it's not going to be prejudiced against people, absolutely none. I think it should have a significant effect on discussions about it. I think it's going to be something incredibly contentious if that's what it gets down to, especially in this sort of political climate, but the reality is it's going to be used in nefarious ways. It's not going to be used equally."

I don't really think there's much of an in-between. Those are two extremes. Or at the very least, if you're not feeling like an extreme, black or white, you're in a gray area in the middle, it's you're gonna be uncomfortable with it, knowing that you're being watched at all times and that potentially something can be used against you. Or maybe if you have a stalker, especially someone who's in law enforcement, you might worry about what that'll do. Or if you have someone in law enforcement who has a vendetta against you, there are absolutely evil people in law enforcement. Not everybody, but very many. And that would absolutely be concerning. Privacy invasion, people are already paranoid with the intranets and how things can be tracked back to them and how they can be stalked or things like that. It's going to be so much worse with just cameras pointing at you everywhere. I would say it's a pretty strong connection and it has a very negative effect."

Yeah, it would definitely help people feel like if something happens to them, they're more likely to get justice and might deter people.

I can see it immediately being something that people would be able to very easily mark as a sort of bias, some sort of discrimination. If things happened all at once, maybe it would actually be less obvious. I really can't imagine how it would go, and I think this completely depends on the area that you are in and the way that things are where you are. Like, it's completely dependent.

Already law enforcement should be turning on their body cameras for things when they just don't. They turn it off and they commit crimes, things like that.

In the same way that there's more police surveillance in areas where there are poorer people or people of color, the same thing's going to happen with surveillance technology. There's no way it's not going to be prejudiced against people, absolutely none. I think it should have a significant effect on discussions about it.

I don't really think there's much of an in-between. Those are two extremes. Or at the very least, if you're not feeling like an extreme, black or white, you're in a gray area in the middle, it's you're gonna be uncomfortable with it, knowing that you're being watched at all times and that potentially something can be used against you. Or maybe if you have a stalker, especially someone who's in law enforcement, you might worry about what that'll do. Or if you have someone in law enforcement who has a vendetta against you, there are absolutely evil people in law enforcement. Not everybody, but very many. And that would absolutely be concerning. Privacy invasion, people are already paranoid with the intranets and how things can be tracked back to them and how they can be stalked or things like that.

Yeah, it would definitely help people feel like if something happens to them, they're more likely to get justice and might deter people.

I can see it immediately being something that people would be able to very easily mark as a sort of bias, some sort of discrimination. If things happened all at once, maybe it would actually be less obvious. I really can't imagine how it would go, and I think this completely depends on the area that you are in and the way that things are where you are. Like, it's completely dependent.

And it's not like every single person is consenting to being filmed every moment of their lives in the area that they're in. And even if you know it's there, like you can't opt out of it, you can't say yes or no, you just exist in those areas and don't have a choice. So I would say it's an immediate effect. I don't understand how it would take time to develop if the cameras are just there already. And of course it has a negative effect, a very strong effect.

I mean, being weary of others is a pretty, I guess it's important to be weary of others. I think we should be weary of others even without surveillance cameras. I don't understand what this question is pointing to. I think it may be one of the questions that is like added because of one of the answers that I gave and I don't quite know how to answer it.

And back when it was also asked, is the effect of breach of privacy on support in the last few questions? So it's the exact same answer that I would give.

It's already something that exists and something that, I mean, if it were getting worse or better, there's no way it would get better with surveillance cameras. It would just be getting worse. Of course it would have a negative effect on it. And of course it would be strong depending on the community in which you live. It's totally dependent on where you live and what things are like in your area. I think the only people that would be pleased that more racial profiling was happening are likely incredibly right-wing or potentially racist. I don't see any positive unless somehow racial profiling were getting better, which it wouldn't be if you're trying to find criminals on cameras."

      "answer": "This question answers itself, small changes in negative economic impact. So I assume this would mean economic impact is getting worse. If negative economic impact is becoming more negative, it's going to have a negative effect. If small changes in negative economic impact means it's becoming less negative, then it will have a positive impact. This question answers itself, so it's kind of redundant."

      "answer": "Oh, for sure. If law enforcement were less corrupt and more trustworthy and had a better relationship with communities, then yes, definitely it would be easier for people to accept them as enforcing surveillance, which again is still a breach of privacy. But I think taking out the effects of a corrupt law enforcement is definitely a very positive impact, and it's a pretty strong effect because I think one of the biggest recoils is distrust for the police. So if that were definitely restructured and made better, if it were reformed, so to say, I think that that would be good for everybody, not even just in this effect, just altogether. So it would be a net positive if the laws of law enforcement were reformed, for sure."

Because yes, using something for a bad thing is bad. And I think most people would see it as bad. So I think that this is a question maybe the AI picked up on, but it answers itself right there."

It's political surveillance, potentially surveillance by law enforcement that feels scorned or even an individual that feels scorned. It can be stalking, obsession. There are a multitude of reasons, financial reasons, financial, personal, political. Those are the big three. And of course I'm certain about these relationships. They happen all the time. There's tons of privacy invasion over the internet constantly to begin with. There's always stalking. Things like this just make them significantly more dangerous. So it's like already pre-existing privacy invasion made so much easier for the offenders. And of course they're a very negative thing. I can't imagine privacy invasion would ever be a positive thing. And you can even argue in cases of like, oh, well they find criminals through that. Yeah, okay, well also regular people are hurt through that very significantly. So it's not for the greater good, not at all."

It's already something that exists and something that, I mean, if it were getting worse or better, there's no way it would get better with surveillance cameras. It would just be getting worse. Of course it would have a negative effect on it. And of course it would be strong depending on the community in which you live. It's totally dependent on where you live and what things are like in your area. I think the only people that would be pleased that more racial profiling was happening are likely incredibly right-wing or potentially racist.

If law enforcement were less corrupt and more trustworthy and had a better relationship with communities, then yes, definitely it would be easier for people to accept them as enforcing surveillance, which again is still a breach of privacy. But I think taking out the effects of a corrupt law enforcement is definitely a very positive impact, and it's a pretty strong effect because I think one of the biggest recoils is distrust for the police. So if that were definitely restructured and made better, if it were reformed, so to say, I think that that would be good for everybody, not even just in this effect, just altogether.

I would say that if law enforcement has this kind of insane power, then of course there's an imbalance between them and just the general population, which is where privacy advocates would be, unless, A, it would be great if there were a privacy advocate in government or local governments.

There are a multitude of reasons, financial reasons, financial, personal, political. Those are the big three. And of course I'm certain about these relationships. They happen all the time. There's tons of privacy invasion over the internet constantly to begin with. There's always stalking. Things like this just make them significantly more dangerous. So it's like already pre-existing privacy invasion made so much easier for the offenders. And of course they're a very negative thing. I can't imagine privacy invasion would ever be a positive thing.

There's no way, it's going to be really bad. The grainy footage, it's not like we're gonna have HD cameras on every street. It's going to be grainy, especially at night.

I think it needs to be dismantled and rebuilt from the ground up to be an institution that is not prejudiced and violent and lawless. So I think that privacy advocates should absolutely be listened to far more because so far the people don't have power when it comes to fighting against law enforcement, speaking out against law enforcement. Already law enforcement should be turning on their body cameras for things when they just don't. They turn it off and they commit crimes, things like that. I think that we have to deal with law enforcement and how corrupt it is first before we even consider giving them any sort of extra leverage on innocent people who they are just destroying the communities of."

There's no way there's not going to be a bias added to this surveillance. It's going to be absolutely terrible. In the same way that there's more police surveillance in areas where there are poorer people or people of color, the same thing's going to happen with surveillance technology. There's no way it's not going to be prejudiced against people, absolutely none. I think it should have a significant effect on discussions about it. I think it's going to be something incredibly contentious if that's what it gets down to, especially in this sort of political climate, but the reality is it's going to be used in nefarious ways. It's not going to be used equally."

I don't really think there's much of an in-between. Those are two extremes. Or at the very least, if you're not feeling like an extreme, black or white, you're in a gray area in the middle, it's you're gonna be uncomfortable with it, knowing that you're being watched at all times and that potentially something can be used against you. Or maybe if you have a stalker, especially someone who's in law enforcement, you might worry about what that'll do. Or if you have someone in law enforcement who has a vendetta against you, there are absolutely evil people in law enforcement. Not everybody, but very many. And that would absolutely be concerning. Privacy invasion, people are already paranoid with the intranets and how things can be tracked back to them and how they can be stalked or things like that. It's going to be so much worse with just cameras pointing at you everywhere. I would say it's a pretty strong connection and it has a very negative effect."

I would say it has a positive effect and support and I would say not the strongest effect ever, but definitely a strong effect. Yeah, it would definitely help people feel like if something happens to them, they're more likely to get justice and might deter people.

I can see it immediately being something that people would be able to very easily mark as a sort of bias, some sort of discrimination. If things happened all at once, maybe it would actually be less obvious. I really can't imagine how it would go, and I think this completely depends on the area that you are in and the way that things are where you are. Like, it's completely dependent.

Maybe it'll make you feel safer just walking along the street. I think this falls into the exact same vein, like yes, public safety and crime deterrence fall hand in hand.

And it's not like every single person is consenting to being filmed every moment of their lives in the area that they're in. And even if you know it's there, like you can't opt out of it, you can't say yes or no, you just exist in those areas and don't have a choice. So I would say it's an immediate effect. I don't understand how it would take time to develop if the cameras are just there already. And of course it has a negative effect, a very strong effect.

Already law enforcement should be turning on their body cameras for things when they just don't. They turn it off and they commit crimes, things like that.

There's no way there's not going to be a bias added to this surveillance. It's going to be absolutely terrible. In the same way that there's more police surveillance in areas where there are poorer people or people of color, the same thing's going to happen with surveillance technology. There's no way it's not going to be prejudiced against people, absolutely none. I think it should have a significant effect on discussions about it.

I don't really think there's much of an in-between. Those are two extremes. Or at the very least, if you're not feeling like an extreme, black or white, you're in a gray area in the middle, it's you're gonna be uncomfortable with it, knowing that you're being watched at all times and that potentially something can be used against you. Or maybe if you have a stalker, especially someone who's in law enforcement, you might worry about what that'll do. Or if you have someone in law enforcement who has a vendetta against you, there are absolutely evil people in law enforcement. Not everybody, but very many. And that would absolutely be concerning. Privacy invasion, people are already paranoid with the intranets and how things can be tracked back to them and how they can be stalked or things like that.

I would say it has a positive effect and support and I would say not the strongest effect ever, but definitely a strong effect. Yeah, it would definitely help people feel like if something happens to them, they're more likely to get justice and might deter people.

I can see it immediately being something that people would be able to very easily mark as a sort of bias, some sort of discrimination. If things happened all at once, maybe it would actually be less obvious. I really can't imagine how it would go, and I think this completely depends on the area that you are in and the way that things are where you are. Like, it's completely dependent.

Maybe it'll make you feel safer just walking along the street. I think this falls into the exact same vein, like yes, public safety and crime deterrence fall hand in hand.

      "answer": "Oh, that's absolutely immediate. Yeah, your privacy is breached the moment that you're being filmed without your consent. And it's not like every single person is consenting to being filmed every moment of their lives in the area that they're in. And even if you know it's there, like you can't opt out of it, you can't say yes or no, you just exist in those areas and don't have a choice. So I would say it's an immediate effect. I don't understand how it would take time to develop if the cameras are just there already. And of course it has a negative effect, a very strong effect. That's one of the biggest reasons that people would despise it or dislike it or not want it."

I mean, being weary of others is a pretty, I guess it's important to be weary of others. I think we should be weary of others even without surveillance cameras. I don't understand what this question is pointing to. I think it may be one of the questions that is like added because of one of the answers that I gave and I don't quite know how to answer it.

And back when it was also asked, is the effect of breach of privacy on support in the last few questions? So it's the exact same answer that I would give.

      "answer": "I think that generally racial profiling would lead to very, I don't understand what small changes in racial profiling means. It's already something that exists and something that, I mean, if it were getting worse or better, there's no way it would get better with surveillance cameras. It would just be getting worse. Of course it would have a negative effect on it. And of course it would be strong depending on the community in which you live. It's totally dependent on where you live and what things are like in your area. I think the only people that would be pleased that more racial profiling was happening are likely incredibly right-wing or potentially racist. I don't see any positive unless somehow racial profiling were getting better, which it wouldn't be if you're trying to find criminals on cameras."

If negative economic impact is becoming more negative, it's going to have a negative effect. If small changes in negative economic impact means it's becoming less negative, then it will have a positive impact. This question answers itself, so it's kind of redundant."

      "answer": "Oh, for sure. If law enforcement were less corrupt and more trustworthy and had a better relationship with communities, then yes, definitely it would be easier for people to accept them as enforcing surveillance, which again is still a breach of privacy. But I think taking out the effects of a corrupt law enforcement is definitely a very positive impact, and it's a pretty strong effect because I think one of the biggest recoils is distrust for the police. So if that were definitely restructured and made better, if it were reformed, so to say, I think that that would be good for everybody, not even just in this effect, just altogether. So it would be a net positive if the laws of law enforcement were reformed, for sure."

      "answer": "I think this is based on one of the questions I was asked, which is, yeah, I would say this is law enforcement has a say in absolutely everything. They have more power and are completely lawless. It's like cops can get away with so many horrific things and the judicial system is not all that much better for the most part. I would say that if law enforcement has this kind of insane power, then of course there's an imbalance between them and just the general population, which is where privacy advocates would be, unless, A, it would be great if there were a privacy advocate in government or local governments. But aside from that, no, the general public do not have as much power as law enforcement. It's a very strong connection to it and has a very negative effect against surveillance."

      "answer": "I mean, privacy invasion happens for very many reasons. It's political surveillance, potentially surveillance by law enforcement that feels scorned or even an individual that feels scorned. It can be stalking, obsession. There are a multitude of reasons, financial reasons, financial, personal, political. Those are the big three. And of course I'm certain about these relationships. They happen all the time. There's tons of privacy invasion over the internet constantly to begin with. There's always stalking. Things like this just make them significantly more dangerous. So it's like already pre-existing privacy invasion made so much easier for the offenders. And of course they're a very negative thing. I can't imagine privacy invasion would ever be a positive thing. And you can even argue in cases of like, oh, well they find criminals through that. Yeah, okay, well also regular people are hurt through that very significantly. So it's not for the greater good, not at all."

I mean, being weary of others is a pretty, I guess it's important to be weary of others. I think we should be weary of others even without surveillance cameras. I don't understand what this question is pointing to. I think it may be one of the questions that is like added because of one of the answers that I gave and I don't quite know how to answer it. So I apologize there. I think that being weary of others sounds like a negative thing generally, but it's something important that we should be doing now even without surveillance cameras."

      "answer": "Once again, I'm pretty sure this question was already asked when it was asked, is the effect of personal privacy on support? And back when it was also asked, is the effect of breach of privacy on support in the last few questions? So it's the exact same answer that I would give. I apologize for repeating that, but it's the same answer. A very negative effect because it's a breach of privacy and people can use that against you."

      "answer": "I think that generally racial profiling would lead to very, I don't understand what small changes in racial profiling means. It's already something that exists and something that, I mean, if it were getting worse or better, there's no way it would get better with surveillance cameras. It would just be getting worse. Of course it would have a negative effect on it. And of course it would be strong depending on the community in which you live. It's totally dependent on where you live and what things are like in your area. I think the only people that would be pleased that more racial profiling was happening are likely incredibly right-wing or potentially racist. I don't see any positive unless somehow racial profiling were getting better, which it wouldn't be if you're trying to find criminals on cameras."

      "answer": "This question answers itself, small changes in negative economic impact. So I assume this would mean economic impact is getting worse. If negative economic impact is becoming more negative, it's going to have a negative effect. If small changes in negative economic impact means it's becoming less negative, then it will have a positive impact. This question answers itself, so it's kind of redundant."

      "answer": "Oh, for sure. If law enforcement were less corrupt and more trustworthy and had a better relationship with communities, then yes, definitely it would be easier for people to accept them as enforcing surveillance, which again is still a breach of privacy. But I think taking out the effects of a corrupt law enforcement is definitely a very positive impact, and it's a pretty strong effect because I think one of the biggest recoils is distrust for the police. So if that were definitely restructured and made better, if it were reformed, so to say, I think that that would be good for everybody, not even just in this effect, just altogether. So it would be a net positive if the laws of law enforcement were reformed, for sure."

      "answer": "I think this is based on one of the questions I was asked, which is, yeah, I would say this is law enforcement has a say in absolutely everything. They have more power and are completely lawless. It's like cops can get away with so many horrific things and the judicial system is not all that much better for the most part. I would say that if law enforcement has this kind of insane power, then of course there's an imbalance between them and just the general population, which is where privacy advocates would be, unless, A, it would be great if there were a privacy advocate in government or local governments. But aside from that, no, the general public do not have as much power as law enforcement. It's a very strong connection to it and has a very negative effect against surveillance."

      "answer": "I mean, privacy invasion happens for very many reasons. It's political surveillance, potentially surveillance by law enforcement that feels scorned or even an individual that feels scorned. It can be stalking, obsession. There are a multitude of reasons, financial reasons, financial, personal, political. Those are the big three. And of course I'm certain about these relationships. They happen all the time. There's tons of privacy invasion over the internet constantly to begin with. There's always stalking. Things like this just make them significantly more dangerous. So it's like already pre-existing privacy invasion made so much easier for the offenders. And of course they're a very negative thing. I can't imagine privacy invasion would ever be a positive thing. And you can even argue in cases of like, oh, well they find criminals through that. Yeah, okay, well also regular people are hurt through that very significantly. So it's not for the greater good, not at all."

I don't really care about capitalist violence per se, people who can't afford to eat and they steal food. I didn't see it. So there's a balance for sure. I think we should protect law enforcement as much as we can when it comes to protecting them from violence. So I would support more surveillance in areas where people are experiencing person-on-person violence versus other non-violent crimes."

Bias is a huge, plays a huge role in so many of our social issues. The lack of education surrounding that, the lack of emotional intelligence in people reaching adulthood is really staggering. It's frightening. I am trying my damnedest to raise my three kids with emotional intelligence and emotional regulation that can also think for themselves and have empathy.

Especially what if someone doctored it or tampered with it and the average person looking at it can't tell. That's a problem. That's problematic. So there's definitely concerns about accuracy, safety, reliability, and what hands those are in and who uses it."

I feel like the interest of law enforcement should be taken into higher consideration in areas where there is a lot of violent crime and by that I mean person-on-person where people are harmed. I don't really care about capitalist violence per se, people who can't afford to eat and they steal food. I didn't see it. So there's a balance for sure. I think we should protect law enforcement as much as we can when it comes to protecting them from violence.

Bias is a huge, plays a huge role in so many of our social issues. The lack of education surrounding that, the lack of emotional intelligence in people reaching adulthood is really staggering. It's frightening. I am trying my damnedest to raise my three kids with emotional intelligence and emotional regulation that can also think for themselves and have empathy.

We want to feel safe in our community when we go out, when we do things in our homes, you name it, safety is our priority.

It's that part, that relationship is the one. So if you feel it's trustworthy, you're going to be in support for it. If you don't feel it's trustworthy, it's not going to develop over time.

I don't really care about capitalist violence per se, people who can't afford to eat and they steal food. I didn't see it. So there's a balance for sure.

So say that you put, there was a lot of theft in a parking lot at the park, and they put surveillance cameras in, and five months later, we find that the crimes in that parking lot have dropped by 75%. That word gets out, people have something substantial to look at and compare to, and I think that support other parks would adopt it. And then other stores would adopt it, and more and more people would trickle in to support for that. That's a pretty strong effect over time, but it's probably more of a trickle effect as it is implemented."

And it's going to take a lot of time for them to trust this and build support, right? They would need to see it wasn't gonna be used to abuse or used to discriminate. If they are given evidence that it's being used correctly and justly, everyone would probably support it to some degree."

Especially what if someone doctored it or tampered with it and the average person looking at it can't tell. That's a problem. That's problematic.

I don't really care about capitalist violence per se, people who can't afford to eat and they steal food. I didn't see it. So there's a balance for sure. I think we should protect law enforcement as much as we can when it comes to protecting them from violence.

Bias is a huge, plays a huge role in so many of our social issues. The lack of education surrounding that, the lack of emotional intelligence in people reaching adulthood is really staggering. It's frightening. I am trying my damnedest to raise my three kids with emotional intelligence and emotional regulation that can also think for themselves and have empathy. I think if we could raise more people like that into adulthood, we could solve problems about bias and social equity in a much greater capacity."

Somebody who had their car hit at Target and the person took off, they would hope they had surveillance cameras to help them in their case. Those effects are pretty significant.

We want to feel safe in our community when we go out, when we do things in our homes, you name it, safety is our priority.

If you don't trust the government, but it's stores or parks doing it, you probably would support it because then you would feel safer. So the connection is definitely present. I guess the answer is who is in charge of installing the surveillance, who is doing the surveilling, and how is that surveillance being handled."

We accept its flaws and we accept its mistakes now. I don't think that would really change. If people fear that it could be doctored with or tampered with, that would affect the support.

      "answer": "The effect of trustworthiness is probably pretty immediate, right, kind of goes in hand and hand with do we trust the government or do we trust whoever is doing the surveilling. It's that part, that relationship is the one. So if you feel it's trustworthy, you're going to be in support for it. If you don't feel it's trustworthy, it's not going to develop over time. It's going to be a negative effect. I think both of those things are immediate and don't really change."

People are gonna support that because there that's areas where crime is noted and constantly happening and we're aware of it and it's areas that are less desirable that you might feel less safe going to. That could help the people who lived there feel more safe. It could help businesses feel more confident about staying open or even coming there at all."

So I guess it would have a neutral effect, right? If you have, if you don't want to acknowledge your bias, you probably are going to be in support for this and you're going to just be thinking crime, crime, crime. If you are a little bit more rational about it, you might be able to, I guess, have a more neutral hand in that. You would want to see it carried out in a more equitable and just way because your bias isn't, the stereotypes in your head aren't guiding that decision like they are for people who haven't addressed their bias."

However, a few years ago that all changed and we no longer qualify for section 8 housing help. due to this we had to move because we couldn’t afford where we were living at anymore because we didn’t have the help anymore.

The robbery at a local store in town called Millers Grocery that happened last month really shakes some people up. if the current cameras didn’t help much then yes definitely be about getting better and more coverage with significant increase likely.

The robbery at a local store in town called Millers Grocery that happened last month really shakes some people up. if the current cameras didn’t help much then yes definitely be about getting better and more coverage with significant increase likely. I also recently saw something in my local paper about the state having funds for community tech. if the town applied and got the grant specifically for more cameras that would definitely lead to an increase."

That was a different experience because my rent was a lot lower, I received food stamps, which made me eligible to get section 8 housing help where they would pay some of my rent for me each month. However, a few years ago that all changed and we no longer qualify for section 8 housing help. due to this we had to move because we couldn’t afford where we were living at anymore because we didn’t have the help anymore. That’s when we moved where we are currently living now. I needed a place that I could afford on my own without all the extra help. My landlord is amazing compared to my last landlord. She is great. One thing that I have definitely noticed Is how much my electricity bill keeps going up like each year literally, my last electric bill was over $1000 because we’re still paying off past due bills. I currently do get lie heap, which is where the government helps me pay my electric bill once a year and they only pay about. I think it was $300 this year. I only get that help one time During one month in the year. honestly, that electric bill is what makes it tough to be able to afford anything else including the price of groceries feels like the economy and all the things that go with it like our gas and our groceries and our healthcare medication’s all just keeps going up in price.",

    "housing_experience": "For the past five years, I’ve been renting the same single family home here in Lewistown, PA. I was in section 8 housing three years ago. That was a different experience because my rent was a lot lower, I received food stamps, which made me eligible to get section 8 housing help where they would pay some of my rent for me each month. However, a few years ago that all changed and we no longer qualify for section 8 housing help. due to this we had to move because we couldn’t afford where we were living at anymore because we didn’t have the help anymore. That’s when we moved where we are currently living now. I needed a place that I could afford on my own without all the extra help. My landlord is amazing compared to my last landlord. She is great. One thing that I have definitely noticed Is how much my electricity bill keeps going up like each year literally, my last electric bill was over $1000 because we’re still paying off past due bills. I currently do get lie heap, which is where the government helps me pay my electric bill once a year and they only pay about. I think it was $300 this year. I only get that help one time During one month in the year. honestly, that electric bill is what makes it tough to be able to afford anything else including the price of groceries feels like the economy and all the things that go with it like our gas and our groceries and our healthcare medication’s all just keeps going up in price.",

However, a few years ago that all changed and we no longer qualify for section 8 housing help. due to this we had to move because we couldn’t afford where we were living at anymore because we didn’t have the help anymore.

That was a different experience because my rent was a lot lower, I received food stamps, which made me eligible to get section 8 housing help where they would pay some of my rent for me each month. However, a few years ago that all changed and we no longer qualify for section 8 housing help. due to this we had to move because we couldn’t afford where we were living at anymore because we didn’t have the help anymore. That’s when we moved where we are currently living now. I needed a place that I could afford on my own without all the extra help. My landlord is amazing compared to my last landlord. She is great. One thing that I have definitely noticed Is how much my electricity bill keeps going up like each year literally, my last electric bill was over $1000 because we’re still paying off past due bills. I currently do get lie heap, which is where the government helps me pay my electric bill once a year and they only pay about. I think it was $300 this year. I only get that help one time During one month in the year. honestly, that electric bill is what makes it tough to be able to afford anything else including the price of groceries feels like the economy and all the things that go with it like our gas and our groceries and our healthcare medication’s all just keeps going up in price.",

As I said earlier, it's important that people feel that their data isn't being misused or mishandled in a way that these surveillance systems weren't intended to be used for.

      "answer": "Malfunction in these surveillance systems will undoubtedly have a negative effect on support for these surveillance systems. It's extremely important that these systems work as intended and when they are needed most. What good are these systems if they're not functioning? When a crime is being committed, for instance."

      "answer": "I think it would take larger shifts of privacy protections to cause noticeable changes in support. As I said earlier, it's important that people feel that their data isn't being misused or mishandled in a way that these surveillance systems weren't intended to be used for. Any of these privacy changes must be clearly and directly communicated with the communities affected by these changes or else you will see less and less support in general."

If these changes infringe on people's privacy further than necessary, or in a way that makes people feel less safe, then that will undoubtedly have a negative effect on support for these systems. It's important to make sure that any of these changes are handled with care, and in a way that the community can be ensured these changes are for the better."

The effects of these cameras should undoubtedly affect the rate of crime in the areas they are put. If the crime rate decreases, then it's safe to say these changes are positive. If additional cameras does not lead to less crime, then these changes will be seen as negative."

Only when people start seeing noticeable changes in the rate of crime will there be an equally great reaction. An increase in crime rate, for instance, would cause opposition to these changes, but a decrease in crime rate will, in my opinion, only increase support."

The impact would need to start in neighborhoods where they wouldn't get as much pushback. You can't start surveillance cameras in poor neighborhoods with high crime.
