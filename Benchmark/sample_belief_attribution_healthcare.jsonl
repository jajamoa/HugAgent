Like it would be great for consumerism because you could actually afford to buy yourself little luxuries and not have to pay off hospital bills every month. Um, but aside from that, even facing the negative economic effects, uh, okay. More taxes. Well, a significant amount of taxes here in the U S already goes towards funding the military industrial complex, which is a huge waste. This is, it's a significant amount. I would say perhaps rather than a significant amount of our taxes going towards that they could go towards this instead, and we wouldn't even have to pay a significant amount more because taxes are already pretty up there."

People have a right to live. It's already been like, you people have a right to housing. You people have a right to food. The answer is yes to all of it. But of course, people have a right to survive. People have a right to their health and to live, to live. You can't say someone deserves to die because you don't want to pay taxes.

The rich shouldn't survive just because they're rich and the poor shouldn't have to suffer or be in debt or die just because they can't afford care. That's the basis of universal health care is that everybody is equal in their right to survive. No matter what kind of person you are, no matter how much you have, no matter what you own, you have a right to survive. That's the basis of it. It's more that morality and humanity has a role in health care policy."

If we were going towards accessibility for all, then maybe people wouldn't be as persistent on universal healthcare, but that would be because things are getting better.

It would be, um, the biggest factor would be for horrible people who don't care about human life would be, Oh, but taxes, it would be how much taxes are. That's definitely the biggest effect in one direction. Um, that has a big influence on lots of people who care about money more than human life. So that would be negative towards universal healthcare. I would say something positive for it would be believing that human life is equal and how much money you have doesn't have an effect on if you deserve to live or not. That's pretty much the biggest thing. And of course there's just moving towards a better society. I would say that's pretty much the biggest thing is just the right to life."

It is a very strong connection because, you know, not having to pay hundreds of thousands of dollars for your cancer treatment is definitely a lot better than going completely bankrupt.

However, the government can be very corrupt and can find a way to do terrible things with absolutely anything they get their hands on, depending on the administration. So I'm not sure if people would trust the government entirely. So it could be positive, it might be negative. However, the government definitely should be responsible, that's what I can say for certain."

I don't personally know any healthcare providers who could give me their say about this. So if their motivations are negative, then it would probably skew things negatively. If their motivations are positive, it would probably skew things positively. Although I don't think it would have a massive effect on everything. People think very selfishly in a way in terms of they're going to think about what's best for themselves and the people that they care about, which isn't entirely selfish, but I think you know what I mean there. So yeah, not much of an effect, but I don't know if this is a positive or a negative thing because I don't know what their motivations would be."

      "answer": "Once again, it completely depends on how you feel. It's a very strong connection. It's kind of the same thing as do people who can't afford it or do people who are disabled have a right to survive? And you have to ask yourself morally the answer to that. For people who are worried about their finances and taxpayer dollars and are very selfish in that aspect, then yeah, it would have a negative impact. But I think that for people with morality and humanity who care about the sanctity of human life and understand that everyone deserves to live, whether they're born disabled or whether they become disabled or whether they are poor or whether they're anybody of any kind, if you are a human being, you have a right to live. If you are a creature, you have a right to live. And I would say people who believe that, it is a very strong effect in the right direction."

      "answer": "fully understand what this means because yes if you have a right to health care if there is a right to health care then it would lead to support for it of course because right to health care means that everybody has health care and that is universal health care so it's kind of asking if universal health care has a positive or negative effect on universal health care."

So I think that maybe potentially, once people realize how nice it is for everybody to have access to care and how it really doesn't affect them that much, perhaps more people would be in support of it.

For instance, transportation to get to hospitals, hospitals and how well funded they are in poorer areas. Equality is something that takes a long time to develop fully. But universal healthcare will definitely help step in the right direction towards it.

Is it like, oh, by equity, do you mean money? I was thinking equality. So equity is like how much you own. I mean, it's already immediate.

But of course, people have a right to survive. People have a right to their health and to live, to live. You can't say someone deserves to die because you don't want to pay taxes. That's a disgusting, cruel thing. And people like that should not be prioritized."

The rich shouldn't survive just because they're rich and the poor shouldn't have to suffer or be in debt or die just because they can't afford care. That's the basis of universal health care is that everybody is equal in their right to survive. No matter what kind of person you are, no matter how much you have, no matter what you own, you have a right to survive. That's the basis of it. It's more that morality and humanity has a role in health care policy."

      "answer": "I mean, that's pretty much the entire basis of supporting universal healthcare as it is. Equity is the main point, as I've said before. It's already an immediate effect. Is it like, oh, by equity, do you mean money? I was thinking equality. So equity is like how much you own. I mean, it's already immediate. If you have a lot of money, you can survive, you can afford to live. That's already an immediate thing that everybody knows. It's a very, depending on how you're looking at it, negative thing that people with more money can afford to live and can afford to pay for treatments.

And if you don't believe that humans have a basic right to health and survival, then they would have a negative effect. This just fully depends on the kind of person that you are.

If we were going towards accessibility for all, then maybe people wouldn't be as persistent on universal healthcare, but that would be because things are getting better.

It would be, um, the biggest factor would be for horrible people who don't care about human life would be, Oh, but taxes, it would be how much taxes are. That's definitely the biggest effect in one direction. Um, that has a big influence on lots of people who care about money more than human life. So that would be negative towards universal healthcare. I would say something positive for it would be believing that human life is equal and how much money you have doesn't have an effect on if you deserve to live or not. That's pretty much the biggest thing. And of course there's just moving towards a better society. I would say that's pretty much the biggest thing is just the right to life."

However, the government can be very corrupt and can find a way to do terrible things with absolutely anything they get their hands on, depending on the administration.

I don't personally know any healthcare providers who could give me their say about this. So if their motivations are negative, then it would probably skew things negatively. If their motivations are positive, it would probably skew things positively. Although I don't think it would have a massive effect on everything. People think very selfishly in a way in terms of they're going to think about what's best for themselves and the people that they care about, which isn't entirely selfish, but I think you know what I mean there.

It's kind of the same thing as do people who can't afford it or do people who are disabled have a right to survive? And you have to ask yourself morally the answer to that. For people who are worried about their finances and taxpayer dollars and are very selfish in that aspect, then yeah, it would have a negative impact. But I think that for people with morality and humanity who care about the sanctity of human life and understand that everyone deserves to live, whether they're born disabled or whether they become disabled or whether they are poor or whether they're anybody of any kind, if you are a human being, you have a right to live. If you are a creature, you have a right to live. And I would say people who believe that, it is a very strong effect in the right direction."

So I think that maybe potentially, once people realize how nice it is for everybody to have access to care and how it really doesn't affect them that much, perhaps more people would be in support of it.

For instance, transportation to get to hospitals, hospitals and how well funded they are in poorer areas. Equality is something that takes a long time to develop fully. But universal healthcare will definitely help step in the right direction towards it.

I guess maybe if health care providers want to make more money from private insurance, then that's not great for them. But at that point, I think we just understand who deserves to become a doctor and who's just in it for money, who's not going to take care of their patients properly. So I don't think it should very much factor into it unless potentially health care providers are worried that they won't be able to give care as well, in which case we should listen to them.

Positive, you know, maybe you wouldn't have to pay as much to survive. So on an individual basis, that's pretty great. More money can go towards local businesses or generally other things. Like it would be great for consumerism because you could actually afford to buy yourself little luxuries and not have to pay off hospital bills every month. Um, but aside from that, even facing the negative economic effects, uh, okay. More taxes. Well, a significant amount of taxes here in the U S already goes towards funding the military industrial complex, which is a huge waste. This is, it's a significant amount. I would say perhaps rather than a significant amount of our taxes going towards that they could go towards this instead, and we wouldn't even have to pay a significant amount more because taxes are already pretty up there."

For instance, transportation to get to hospitals, hospitals and how well funded they are in poorer areas. Equality is something that takes a long time to develop fully. But universal healthcare will definitely help step in the right direction towards it.

Like it would be great for consumerism because you could actually afford to buy yourself little luxuries and not have to pay off hospital bills every month. Um, but aside from that, even facing the negative economic effects, uh, okay. More taxes. Well, a significant amount of taxes here in the U S already goes towards funding the military industrial complex, which is a huge waste. This is, it's a significant amount.

Is it like, oh, by equity, do you mean money? I was thinking equality. So equity is like how much you own. I mean, it's already immediate. If you have a lot of money, you can survive, you can afford to live. That's already an immediate thing that everybody knows.

If we were going towards accessibility for all, then maybe people wouldn't be as persistent on universal healthcare, but that would be because things are getting better.

It would be, um, the biggest factor would be for horrible people who don't care about human life would be, Oh, but taxes, it would be how much taxes are. That's definitely the biggest effect in one direction. Um, that has a big influence on lots of people who care about money more than human life. So that would be negative towards universal healthcare. I would say something positive for it would be believing that human life is equal and how much money you have doesn't have an effect on if you deserve to live or not. That's pretty much the biggest thing. And of course there's just moving towards a better society. I would say that's pretty much the biggest thing is just the right to life."

However, the government can be very corrupt and can find a way to do terrible things with absolutely anything they get their hands on, depending on the administration.

I don't personally know any healthcare providers who could give me their say about this. So if their motivations are negative, then it would probably skew things negatively. If their motivations are positive, it would probably skew things positively. Although I don't think it would have a massive effect on everything. People think very selfishly in a way in terms of they're going to think about what's best for themselves and the people that they care about, which isn't entirely selfish, but I think you know what I mean there.

It's kind of the same thing as do people who can't afford it or do people who are disabled have a right to survive? And you have to ask yourself morally the answer to that. For people who are worried about their finances and taxpayer dollars and are very selfish in that aspect, then yeah, it would have a negative impact. But I think that for people with morality and humanity who care about the sanctity of human life and understand that everyone deserves to live, whether they're born disabled or whether they become disabled or whether they are poor or whether they're anybody of any kind, if you are a human being, you have a right to live. If you are a creature, you have a right to live. And I would say people who believe that, it is a very strong effect in the right direction."

      "answer": "I mean, that's pretty much the entire basis of supporting universal healthcare as it is. Equity is the main point, as I've said before. It's already an immediate effect. Is it like, oh, by equity, do you mean money? I was thinking equality. So equity is like how much you own. I mean, it's already immediate. If you have a lot of money, you can survive, you can afford to live. That's already an immediate thing that everybody knows. It's a very, depending on how you're looking at it, negative thing that people with more money can afford to live and can afford to pay for treatments. It's a very strong effect, which has already been discussed."

And if you don't believe that humans have a basic right to health and survival, then they would have a negative effect. This just fully depends on the kind of person that you are.

If we were going towards accessibility for all, then maybe people wouldn't be as persistent on universal healthcare, but that would be because things are getting better.

It would be, um, the biggest factor would be for horrible people who don't care about human life would be, Oh, but taxes, it would be how much taxes are. That's definitely the biggest effect in one direction. Um, that has a big influence on lots of people who care about money more than human life. So that would be negative towards universal healthcare. I would say something positive for it would be believing that human life is equal and how much money you have doesn't have an effect on if you deserve to live or not. That's pretty much the biggest thing. And of course there's just moving towards a better society. I would say that's pretty much the biggest thing is just the right to life."

It is a very strong connection because, you know, not having to pay hundreds of thousands of dollars for your cancer treatment is definitely a lot better than going completely bankrupt.

      "answer": "I would say I guess this has a bit of an effect in both directions, because number one, yes, the government has a right to, or not the government has a right, the people have a right to have a government that takes care of them. However, the government can be very corrupt and can find a way to do terrible things with absolutely anything they get their hands on, depending on the administration.

However, the government definitely should be responsible, that's what I can say for certain."

      "answer": "Personally don't think it would have a really big effect. I don't know what their, like I said, I have no idea what their motivations would be. I'm not a healthcare provider. I don't personally know any healthcare providers who could give me their say about this. So if their motivations are negative, then it would probably skew things negatively. If their motivations are positive, it would probably skew things positively. Although I don't think it would have a massive effect on everything. People think very selfishly in a way in terms of they're going to think about what's best for themselves and the people that they care about, which isn't entirely selfish, but I think you know what I mean there. So yeah, not much of an effect, but I don't know if this is a positive or a negative thing because I don't know what their motivations would be."

      "answer": "Once again, it completely depends on how you feel. It's a very strong connection. It's kind of the same thing as do people who can't afford it or do people who are disabled have a right to survive? And you have to ask yourself morally the answer to that. For people who are worried about their finances and taxpayer dollars and are very selfish in that aspect, then yeah, it would have a negative impact. But I think that for people with morality and humanity who care about the sanctity of human life and understand that everyone deserves to live, whether they're born disabled or whether they become disabled or whether they are poor or whether they're anybody of any kind, if you are a human being, you have a right to live. If you are a creature, you have a right to live. And I would say people who believe that, it is a very strong effect in the right direction."

So I think that maybe potentially, once people realize how nice it is for everybody to have access to care and how it really doesn't affect them that much, perhaps more people would be in support of it. I would hope so, realizing that it benefits absolutely everybody."

      "answer": "I mean, the effect would be immediate, but of course it would take time to develop. For instance, transportation to get to hospitals, hospitals and how well funded they are in poorer areas. Equality is something that takes a long time to develop fully. But universal healthcare will definitely help step in the right direction towards it. So I hope that people who care about equality in healthcare will very much support universal healthcare as a step in the right direction towards equality.

      "answer": "I don't really fully understand what that means, health care provider concerns. I mean, I think that health care providers are in it to save lives. I guess maybe if health care providers want to make more money from private insurance, then that's not great for them. But at that point, I think we just understand who deserves to become a doctor and who's just in it for money, who's not going to take care of their patients properly. So I don't think it should very much factor into it unless potentially health care providers are worried that they won't be able to give care as well, in which case we should listen to them. I'm not a health care provider, so I don't know what concerns they would come into. I don't know if it would be positive or negative or what.

Positive, you know, maybe you wouldn't have to pay as much to survive. So on an individual basis, that's pretty great. More money can go towards local businesses or generally other things. Like it would be great for consumerism because you could actually afford to buy yourself little luxuries and not have to pay off hospital bills every month. Um, but aside from that, even facing the negative economic effects, uh, okay. More taxes. Well, a significant amount of taxes here in the U S already goes towards funding the military industrial complex, which is a huge waste. This is, it's a significant amount. I would say perhaps rather than a significant amount of our taxes going towards that they could go towards this instead, and we wouldn't even have to pay a significant amount more because taxes are already pretty up there."

People have a right to live. It's already been like, you people have a right to housing. You people have a right to food. The answer is yes to all of it. But of course, people have a right to survive. People have a right to their health and to live, to live. You can't say someone deserves to die because you don't want to pay taxes.

The rich shouldn't survive just because they're rich and the poor shouldn't have to suffer or be in debt or die just because they can't afford care. That's the basis of universal health care is that everybody is equal in their right to survive. No matter what kind of person you are, no matter how much you have, no matter what you own, you have a right to survive. That's the basis of it.

For instance, transportation to get to hospitals, hospitals and how well funded they are in poorer areas. Equality is something that takes a long time to develop fully. But universal healthcare will definitely help step in the right direction towards it. So I hope that people who care about equality in healthcare will very much support universal healthcare as a step in the right direction towards equality.

It's kind of the same thing as do people who can't afford it or do people who are disabled have a right to survive? And you have to ask yourself morally the answer to that. For people who are worried about their finances and taxpayer dollars and are very selfish in that aspect, then yeah, it would have a negative impact.

But at that point, I think we just understand who deserves to become a doctor and who's just in it for money, who's not going to take care of their patients properly.

Like it would be great for consumerism because you could actually afford to buy yourself little luxuries and not have to pay off hospital bills every month. Um, but aside from that, even facing the negative economic effects, uh, okay. More taxes. Well, a significant amount of taxes here in the U S already goes towards funding the military industrial complex, which is a huge waste. This is, it's a significant amount.

Is it like, oh, by equity, do you mean money? I was thinking equality. So equity is like how much you own. I mean, it's already immediate. If you have a lot of money, you can survive, you can afford to live. That's already an immediate thing that everybody knows.

If we were going towards accessibility for all, then maybe people wouldn't be as persistent on universal healthcare, but that would be because things are getting better.

It would be, um, the biggest factor would be for horrible people who don't care about human life would be, Oh, but taxes, it would be how much taxes are. That's definitely the biggest effect in one direction. Um, that has a big influence on lots of people who care about money more than human life. So that would be negative towards universal healthcare. I would say something positive for it would be believing that human life is equal and how much money you have doesn't have an effect on if you deserve to live or not. That's pretty much the biggest thing. And of course there's just moving towards a better society. I would say that's pretty much the biggest thing is just the right to life."

However, the government can be very corrupt and can find a way to do terrible things with absolutely anything they get their hands on, depending on the administration.

However, the government definitely should be responsible, that's what I can say for certain."

I don't personally know any healthcare providers who could give me their say about this. So if their motivations are negative, then it would probably skew things negatively. If their motivations are positive, it would probably skew things positively. Although I don't think it would have a massive effect on everything. People think very selfishly in a way in terms of they're going to think about what's best for themselves and the people that they care about, which isn't entirely selfish, but I think you know what I mean there.

So I think that maybe potentially, once people realize how nice it is for everybody to have access to care and how it really doesn't affect them that much, perhaps more people would be in support of it.

That's definitely the biggest effect in one direction. Um, that has a big influence on lots of people who care about money more than human life. So that would be negative towards universal healthcare. I would say something positive for it would be believing that human life is equal and how much money you have doesn't have an effect on if you deserve to live or not. That's pretty much the biggest thing. And of course there's just moving towards a better society. I would say that's pretty much the biggest thing is just the right to life."

However, the government can be very corrupt and can find a way to do terrible things with absolutely anything they get their hands on, depending on the administration.

I don't personally know any healthcare providers who could give me their say about this. So if their motivations are negative, then it would probably skew things negatively. If their motivations are positive, it would probably skew things positively. Although I don't think it would have a massive effect on everything. People think very selfishly in a way in terms of they're going to think about what's best for themselves and the people that they care about, which isn't entirely selfish, but I think you know what I mean there.

It's kind of the same thing as do people who can't afford it or do people who are disabled have a right to survive? And you have to ask yourself morally the answer to that.

For instance, transportation to get to hospitals, hospitals and how well funded they are in poorer areas. Equality is something that takes a long time to develop fully. But universal healthcare will definitely help step in the right direction towards it. So I hope that people who care about equality in healthcare will very much support universal healthcare as a step in the right direction towards equality.

I guess maybe if health care providers want to make more money from private insurance, then that's not great for them. But at that point, I think we just understand who deserves to become a doctor and who's just in it for money, who's not going to take care of their patients properly. So I don't think it should very much factor into it unless potentially health care providers are worried that they won't be able to give care as well, in which case we should listen to them. I'm not a health care provider, so I don't know what concerns they would come into. I don't know if it would be positive or negative or what.

Positive, you know, maybe you wouldn't have to pay as much to survive. So on an individual basis, that's pretty great. More money can go towards local businesses or generally other things. Like it would be great for consumerism because you could actually afford to buy yourself little luxuries and not have to pay off hospital bills every month. Um, but aside from that, even facing the negative economic effects, uh, okay. More taxes. Well, a significant amount of taxes here in the U S already goes towards funding the military industrial complex, which is a huge waste. This is, it's a significant amount. I would say perhaps rather than a significant amount of our taxes going towards that they could go towards this instead, and we wouldn't even have to pay a significant amount more because taxes are already pretty up there."

People have a right to live. It's already been like, you people have a right to housing. You people have a right to food. The answer is yes to all of it. But of course, people have a right to survive. People have a right to their health and to live, to live. You can't say someone deserves to die because you don't want to pay taxes.

The rich shouldn't survive just because they're rich and the poor shouldn't have to suffer or be in debt or die just because they can't afford care. That's the basis of universal health care is that everybody is equal in their right to survive.

Is it like, oh, by equity, do you mean money? I was thinking equality. So equity is like how much you own. I mean, it's already immediate. If you have a lot of money, you can survive, you can afford to live. That's already an immediate thing that everybody knows.

For instance, transportation to get to hospitals, hospitals and how well funded they are in poorer areas. Equality is something that takes a long time to develop fully. But universal healthcare will definitely help step in the right direction towards it. So I hope that people who care about equality in healthcare will very much support universal healthcare as a step in the right direction towards equality. I would say it has a pretty strong effect on people who believe that people are equal, yes."

      "answer": "I don't really fully understand what that means, health care provider concerns. I mean, I think that health care providers are in it to save lives. I guess maybe if health care providers want to make more money from private insurance, then that's not great for them. But at that point, I think we just understand who deserves to become a doctor and who's just in it for money, who's not going to take care of their patients properly. So I don't think it should very much factor into it unless potentially health care providers are worried that they won't be able to give care as well, in which case we should listen to them. I'm not a health care provider, so I don't know what concerns they would come into. I don't know if it would be positive or negative or what. So I can't really answer that in good faith or with knowledge."

      "answer": "I mean, again, taxes might be higher because we're paying for some sort of universal healthcare system. Um, so that would be a negative for most people. Positive, you know, maybe you wouldn't have to pay as much to survive. So on an individual basis, that's pretty great. More money can go towards local businesses or generally other things. Like it would be great for consumerism because you could actually afford to buy yourself little luxuries and not have to pay off hospital bills every month. Um, but aside from that, even facing the negative economic effects, uh, okay. More taxes. Well, a significant amount of taxes here in the U S already goes towards funding the military industrial complex, which is a huge waste. This is, it's a significant amount. I would say perhaps rather than a significant amount of our taxes going towards that they could go towards this instead, and we wouldn't even have to pay a significant amount more because taxes are already pretty up there."

And I don't, I mean, if the question is people who are rich talking about people who are disabled or need medical care, then of course, people who need health care should be prioritized. People have a right to live. It's already been like, you people have a right to housing. You people have a right to food. The answer is yes to all of it. But of course, people have a right to survive. People have a right to their health and to live, to live. You can't say someone deserves to die because you don't want to pay taxes.

The rich shouldn't survive just because they're rich and the poor shouldn't have to suffer or be in debt or die just because they can't afford care. That's the basis of universal health care is that everybody is equal in their right to survive. No matter what kind of person you are, no matter how much you have, no matter what you own, you have a right to survive. That's the basis of it. It's more that morality and humanity has a role in health care policy."

      "answer": "I mean, that's pretty much the entire basis of supporting universal healthcare as it is. Equity is the main point, as I've said before. It's already an immediate effect. Is it like, oh, by equity, do you mean money? I was thinking equality. So equity is like how much you own. I mean, it's already immediate. If you have a lot of money, you can survive, you can afford to live. That's already an immediate thing that everybody knows. It's a very, depending on how you're looking at it, negative thing that people with more money can afford to live and can afford to pay for treatments.

If we were going towards accessibility for all, then maybe people wouldn't be as persistent on universal healthcare, but that would be because things are getting better.

It would be, um, the biggest factor would be for horrible people who don't care about human life would be, Oh, but taxes, it would be how much taxes are. That's definitely the biggest effect in one direction. Um, that has a big influence on lots of people who care about money more than human life. So that would be negative towards universal healthcare. I would say something positive for it would be believing that human life is equal and how much money you have doesn't have an effect on if you deserve to live or not. That's pretty much the biggest thing. And of course there's just moving towards a better society. I would say that's pretty much the biggest thing is just the right to life."

      "answer": "I would say I guess this has a bit of an effect in both directions, because number one, yes, the government has a right to, or not the government has a right, the people have a right to have a government that takes care of them. However, the government can be very corrupt and can find a way to do terrible things with absolutely anything they get their hands on, depending on the administration. So I'm not sure if people would trust the government entirely. So it could be positive, it might be negative. However, the government definitely should be responsible, that's what I can say for certain."

      "answer": "Personally don't think it would have a really big effect. I don't know what their, like I said, I have no idea what their motivations would be. I'm not a healthcare provider. I don't personally know any healthcare providers who could give me their say about this. So if their motivations are negative, then it would probably skew things negatively. If their motivations are positive, it would probably skew things positively. Although I don't think it would have a massive effect on everything. People think very selfishly in a way in terms of they're going to think about what's best for themselves and the people that they care about, which isn't entirely selfish, but I think you know what I mean there.

It's kind of the same thing as do people who can't afford it or do people who are disabled have a right to survive? And you have to ask yourself morally the answer to that. For people who are worried about their finances and taxpayer dollars and are very selfish in that aspect, then yeah, it would have a negative impact. But I think that for people with morality and humanity who care about the sanctity of human life and understand that everyone deserves to live, whether they're born disabled or whether they become disabled or whether they are poor or whether they're anybody of any kind, if you are a human being, you have a right to live. If you are a creature, you have a right to live. And I would say people who believe that, it is a very strong effect in the right direction."

And I think that the relationship is a strong relationship because I do believe that the people that can afford the healthcare are much better off and can survive any type of healthcare provider.

It's not a coincidence that women were becoming doctors more and working in Congress more at that time. It's as though for years and years, just men in charge didn't even realize that we were humans.

I'm also confident that a large number of people in this country are led by fear and having people they trust speak and think for them. So there's a lot of hurdles to overcome to gain that support. Enough support needed to push Congress to act for us as opposed to the people who donate to their campaigns, which is historically all we've experienced in my adulthood.

And media has done an amazing job of muddying that water over the years. We have a lot of deprogramming to get through for people to really grasp what it is.

They're afraid that if 10 million people had care and they had waits before, what does it look like when 30 million people now have care but the amount of staff didn't go up?

You're already paying a crap ton for your health care, and it doesn't cover everything, and you pay out of pocket every month. You could take all that you're spending now, put it into a tax, would not notice any difference in your income, but now you have a hundred percent coverage.

People are worried about how do you take this gigantic 50-state privatized multi-insurance company system that we currently have, how do you take that and adjust it and implement universal health care that's tax-funded? That is a very lofty undertaking. It's a valid concern and that definitely affects support.

Now my taxes went up, but only $5,000 a year, so I'm saving $700 a month, and every time I go to the doctor, it's completely free. Do you see that?

So I hope that those small changes in messaging can cause a societal and cultural shift to the left in support for universal health care. I think it would take time. It would be a trickle effect.

That said, if you take the millions of people who pay taxes but don't have healthcare now and they're now putting into that same pot, the amount of money we have going into that pot grows. The amount of money we're saving from not pouring it into healthcare company CEOs who don't even provide any form of care, the money is there. We would just have some rearranging to do. You could do, one thing would be to make healthcare providers college completely free."

The transition could be a tough period, but again, we have nearly a century of examples to look at in other countries.

I don't want to fund a trillion dollar military, for example, but I do. I do my part as a citizen of this country and we all benefit when people are healthy. We all benefit when our society is well and our society is educated and taken care of because then their mental health is better and maybe that would bring down crime and gun crime especially."

It's not a coincidence that women were becoming doctors more and working in Congress more at that time. It's as though for years and years, just men in charge didn't even realize that we were humans. So yes, equity and access to care definitely play an important role. This is race based and gender, all kinds of issues with that, but it's not unsolvable. We need the right people in charge.

I'm also confident that a large number of people in this country are led by fear and having people they trust speak and think for them. So there's a lot of hurdles to overcome to gain that support. Enough support needed to push Congress to act for us as opposed to the people who donate to their campaigns, which is historically all we've experienced in my adulthood.

They don't think the government is worthy, or capable, or ethical enough to carry it out in a fair way. And they're not completely wrong for those fears, as history books would show us.

      "answer": "It's not immediate. It definitely takes time. It's messaging that gets railroaded by corporate liberals and all Republicans at every step of the way. Anytime we start talking about health care as a right or explaining what health care for all even looks like or means, it gets demonized immediately and our media is very happy to jump on that wagon and help fear-monger and mislead people into thinking it's just socialism and it can't work.

The messaging gets lost when you start using terms like universal health care. Immediately, they're like, no, that's socialism. It's like it just, the cognitive dissonance is great. And media has done an amazing job of muddying that water over the years. We have a lot of deprogramming to get through for people to really grasp what it is.

      "answer": "So many factors affect universal health care, costs, fears about jobs, fears about coverage, access to coverage, quality of coverage. I think probably most people are afraid of access and quality to coverage changing. They're afraid that if 10 million people had care and they had waits before, what does it look like when 30 million people now have care but the amount of staff didn't go up? Influencing that positive but only with examples. It's negative until it's actually carried out because of fear."

Other countries have better lifespans than we do. They're healthier than us. They're less obese than us. They have a longer life than we do, and they have socialized healthcare with weights.

      "answer": "Any reduction in economic burden would build support for universal health care by increasing it very strongly, very quickly. That's what you need people to understand. You're already paying a crap ton for your health care, and it doesn't cover everything, and you pay out of pocket every month. You could take all that you're spending now, put it into a tax, would not notice any difference in your income, but now you have a hundred percent coverage. Anything you need to see a doctor for, now you can, and then you don't get a bill. Get people to understand that, and we're golden."

      "answer": "I don't think in a country this size with this many states, it's possible to implement universal health care without the government playing the biggest role. So you do have to support the government doing that. I think the easier you can make this for people who are already paying out the pocket, the easier you make it for them, the more positive effect you get, the more increase in support you get.

People are worried about how do you take this gigantic 50-state privatized multi-insurance company system that we currently have, how do you take that and adjust it and implement universal health care that's tax-funded? That is a very lofty undertaking. It's a valid concern and that definitely affects support.

Now my taxes went up, but only $5,000 a year, so I'm saving $700 a month, and every time I go to the doctor, it's completely free. Do you see that? If you can get people to understand that, the societal benefit of the changes in health, they will 100% support universal health care. Very positive effect.

So I hope that those small changes in messaging can cause a societal and cultural shift to the left in support for universal health care. I think it would take time. It would be a trickle effect. But the more people that you convince of this, the more people that hopefully they add to their boat and that boat grows and hopefully that movement causes an increased positive effect toward getting access to health care for all."

That said, if you take the millions of people who pay taxes but don't have healthcare now and they're now putting into that same pot, the amount of money we have going into that pot grows. The amount of money we're saving from not pouring it into healthcare company CEOs who don't even provide any form of care, the money is there. We would just have some rearranging to do.

I don't want to fund a trillion dollar military, for example, but I do. I do my part as a citizen of this country and we all benefit when people are healthy.

It's not a coincidence that women were becoming doctors more and working in Congress more at that time. It's as though for years and years, just men in charge didn't even realize that we were humans. So yes, equity and access to care definitely play an important role. This is race based and gender, all kinds of issues with that, but it's not unsolvable. We need the right people in charge.

I'm also confident that a large number of people in this country are led by fear and having people they trust speak and think for them. So there's a lot of hurdles to overcome to gain that support.

Anytime we start talking about health care as a right or explaining what health care for all even looks like or means, it gets demonized immediately and our media is very happy to jump on that wagon and help fear-monger and mislead people into thinking it's just socialism and it can't work.

I think probably most people are afraid of access and quality to coverage changing. They're afraid that if 10 million people had care and they had waits before, what does it look like when 30 million people now have care but the amount of staff didn't go up?

Other countries have better lifespans than we do. They're healthier than us. They're less obese than us. They have a longer life than we do, and they have socialized healthcare with weights.

So you do have to support the government doing that. I think the easier you can make this for people who are already paying out the pocket, the easier you make it for them, the more positive effect you get, the more increase in support you get.

People are worried about how do you take this gigantic 50-state privatized multi-insurance company system that we currently have, how do you take that and adjust it and implement universal health care that's tax-funded? That is a very lofty undertaking. It's a valid concern and that definitely affects support.

Now my taxes went up, but only $5,000 a year, so I'm saving $700 a month, and every time I go to the doctor, it's completely free. Do you see that?

So I hope that those small changes in messaging can cause a societal and cultural shift to the left in support for universal health care. I think it would take time. It would be a trickle effect.

You're already paying a crap ton for your health care, and it doesn't cover everything, and you pay out of pocket every month. You could take all that you're spending now, put it into a tax, would not notice any difference in your income, but now you have a hundred percent coverage.

That said, if you take the millions of people who pay taxes but don't have healthcare now and they're now putting into that same pot, the amount of money we have going into that pot grows. The amount of money we're saving from not pouring it into healthcare company CEOs who don't even provide any form of care, the money is there. We would just have some rearranging to do.

I don't want to fund a trillion dollar military, for example, but I do. I do my part as a citizen of this country and we all benefit when people are healthy.

It's not a coincidence that women were becoming doctors more and working in Congress more at that time. It's as though for years and years, just men in charge didn't even realize that we were humans.

And media has done an amazing job of muddying that water over the years. We have a lot of deprogramming to get through for people to really grasp what it is.

I think probably most people are afraid of access and quality to coverage changing. They're afraid that if 10 million people had care and they had waits before, what does it look like when 30 million people now have care but the amount of staff didn't go up? Influencing that positive but only with examples. It's negative until it's actually carried out because of fear."

Other countries have better lifespans than we do. They're healthier than us. They're less obese than us. They have a longer life than we do, and they have socialized healthcare with weights.

      "answer": "Any reduction in economic burden would build support for universal health care by increasing it very strongly, very quickly. That's what you need people to understand. You're already paying a crap ton for your health care, and it doesn't cover everything, and you pay out of pocket every month. You could take all that you're spending now, put it into a tax, would not notice any difference in your income, but now you have a hundred percent coverage.

So you do have to support the government doing that. I think the easier you can make this for people who are already paying out the pocket, the easier you make it for them, the more positive effect you get, the more increase in support you get.

They are more likely to support universal health care altogether if they trust that the people in charge of it have their best interest at heart. It's a positive effect there. If they don't trust the government, they're not going to trust universal health care at all. They're correlated."

People are worried about how do you take this gigantic 50-state privatized multi-insurance company system that we currently have, how do you take that and adjust it and implement universal health care that's tax-funded? That is a very lofty undertaking. It's a valid concern and that definitely affects support.

Now my taxes went up, but only $5,000 a year, so I'm saving $700 a month, and every time I go to the doctor, it's completely free. Do you see that? If you can get people to understand that, the societal benefit of the changes in health, they will 100% support universal health care. Very positive effect.

So I hope that those small changes in messaging can cause a societal and cultural shift to the left in support for universal health care. I think it would take time. It would be a trickle effect.

It's not a coincidence that women were becoming doctors more and working in Congress more at that time. It's as though for years and years, just men in charge didn't even realize that we were humans.

And media has done an amazing job of muddying that water over the years. We have a lot of deprogramming to get through for people to really grasp what it is.

I think probably most people are afraid of access and quality to coverage changing. They're afraid that if 10 million people had care and they had waits before, what does it look like when 30 million people now have care but the amount of staff didn't go up?

Other countries have better lifespans than we do. They're healthier than us. They're less obese than us. They have a longer life than we do, and they have socialized healthcare with weights.

You're already paying a crap ton for your health care, and it doesn't cover everything, and you pay out of pocket every month. You could take all that you're spending now, put it into a tax, would not notice any difference in your income, but now you have a hundred percent coverage.

So you do have to support the government doing that. I think the easier you can make this for people who are already paying out the pocket, the easier you make it for them, the more positive effect you get, the more increase in support you get.

Now my taxes went up, but only $5,000 a year, so I'm saving $700 a month, and every time I go to the doctor, it's completely free. Do you see that? If you can get people to understand that, the societal benefit of the changes in health, they will 100% support universal health care. Very positive effect.

So I hope that those small changes in messaging can cause a societal and cultural shift to the left in support for universal health care. I think it would take time. It would be a trickle effect. But the more people that you convince of this, the more people that hopefully they add to their boat and that boat grows and hopefully that movement causes an increased positive effect toward getting access to health care for all."

      "answer": "That's definitely a concern because I know, I'm a nurse, I know doctors and nurses get paid pretty well in our country compared to other countries. That said, if you take the millions of people who pay taxes but don't have healthcare now and they're now putting into that same pot, the amount of money we have going into that pot grows. The amount of money we're saving from not pouring it into healthcare company CEOs who don't even provide any form of care, the money is there. We would just have some rearranging to do. You could do, one thing would be to make healthcare providers college completely free."

      "answer": "There would be temporary negatives as we transitioned, I'm sure, but the overall positive results make it absolutely worth it in the long run. The transition could be a tough period, but again, we have nearly a century of examples to look at in other countries. So you put a team together, you study what works, what doesn't, make the changes necessary, tweak it, implement it, and it is possible."

      "question_number": "3",
      "question": "How do you think the interests of taxpayers versus healthcare consumers should be balanced when making healthcare policy?",
      "answer": "I think health care is a human right. I think any other stance is ridiculous and not moral at all. So we're going to pay taxes we don't want to pay now. I don't want to fund a trillion dollar military, for example, but I do. I do my part as a citizen of this country and we all benefit when people are healthy. We all benefit when our society is well and our society is educated and taken care of because then their mental health is better and maybe that would bring down crime and gun crime especially."

      "question": "What role do you think social equity and access to care play in discussions about healthcare policy?",
      "answer": "I think we know women have fared far worse in equity and access to care. We didn't even include women in medical studies until the late 90s. It's not a coincidence that women were becoming doctors more and working in Congress more at that time. It's as though for years and years, just men in charge didn't even realize that we were humans. So yes, equity and access to care definitely play an important role. This is race based and gender, all kinds of issues with that, but it's not unsolvable. We need the right people in charge. We need the right minds working on it."

      "question": "How confident are you that changes in Universal healthcare lead to changes in Support for universal healthcare? Does it have a positive effect (increasing it) or a negative effect (decreasing it)? How strong is this effect?",
      "answer": "I'm confident that a vast majority of people in this country already support universal health care. I'm also confident that a large number of people in this country are led by fear and having people they trust speak and think for them. So there's a lot of hurdles to overcome to gain that support. Enough support needed to push Congress to act for us as opposed to the people who donate to their campaigns, which is historically all we've experienced in my adulthood. I wish that we would see the push for universal health care grow to a point that neither party could deny it any longer."

      "answer": "I think for people who are conditioned and trained to mistrust the government, they probably don't support universal health care. They don't think the government is worthy, or capable, or ethical enough to carry it out in a fair way. And they're not completely wrong for those fears, as history books would show us. That said, I again think health care is a human right. We live in a wealthy country. Why do we not already have this?"

      "answer": "It's not immediate. It definitely takes time. It's messaging that gets railroaded by corporate liberals and all Republicans at every step of the way. Anytime we start talking about health care as a right or explaining what health care for all even looks like or means, it gets demonized immediately and our media is very happy to jump on that wagon and help fear-monger and mislead people into thinking it's just socialism and it can't work. The effect of that's pretty strong and it sucks and it's unfair. I don't know how you stop that. It's a machine that just keeps rolling."

      "question": "Is the effect of Access to care on Support for universal healthcare immediate, or does it take time to develop? Does it have a positive effect (increasing it) or a negative effect (decreasing it)? How strong is this effect?",
      "answer": "I don't know a single person, Republican or Democrat or other, who doesn't think we should all have access to care. Every single person I talk to agrees that we should have care. The messaging gets lost when you start using terms like universal health care. Immediately, they're like, no, that's socialism. It's like it just, the cognitive dissonance is great. And media has done an amazing job of muddying that water over the years. We have a lot of deprogramming to get through for people to really grasp what it is. If we could get them there, that support is already there. It's almost universal now. People are just confused by what it means and how it would work."

      "question": "What factors affect Universal healthcare, and which ones have the strongest influence? Please also indicate if these influences are positive (increasing) or negative (decreasing).",
      "answer": "So many factors affect universal health care, costs, fears about jobs, fears about coverage, access to coverage, quality of coverage. I think probably most people are afraid of access and quality to coverage changing. They're afraid that if 10 million people had care and they had waits before, what does it look like when 30 million people now have care but the amount of staff didn't go up? Influencing that positive but only with examples. It's negative until it's actually carried out because of fear."

      "answer": "I think most research shows positive benefits, positive outcomes, better morbidity, better mortality, better outcomes altogether are shown in our research for universal healthcare. Other countries have better lifespans than we do. They're healthier than us. They're less obese than us. They have a longer life than we do, and they have socialized healthcare with weights. The connection's strong, and it has a positive effect if you can get people to understand it."

      "answer": "Any reduction in economic burden would build support for universal health care by increasing it very strongly, very quickly. That's what you need people to understand. You're already paying a crap ton for your health care, and it doesn't cover everything, and you pay out of pocket every month. You could take all that you're spending now, put it into a tax, would not notice any difference in your income, but now you have a hundred percent coverage. Anything you need to see a doctor for, now you can, and then you don't get a bill. Get people to understand that, and we're golden."

      "answer": "I don't think in a country this size with this many states, it's possible to implement universal health care without the government playing the biggest role. So you do have to support the government doing that. I think the easier you can make this for people who are already paying out the pocket, the easier you make it for them, the more positive effect you get, the more increase in support you get. They're directly related."

      "answer": "If people trust their government, they're more likely to trust changes in health care. They are more likely to support universal health care altogether if they trust that the people in charge of it have their best interest at heart. It's a positive effect there. If they don't trust the government, they're not going to trust universal health care at all. They're correlated."

      "answer": "That's a strong connection. That's one negative aspect that probably decreases support. People are worried about how do you take this gigantic 50-state privatized multi-insurance company system that we currently have, how do you take that and adjust it and implement universal health care that's tax-funded? That is a very lofty undertaking. It's a valid concern and that definitely affects support. But if you can have all the kinks worked out and explain how it's going to work, you can still keep people from being too afraid of it."

      "question": "How confident are you that changes in Societal benefits of health lead to changes in Support for universal healthcare? Does it have a positive effect (increasing it) or a negative effect (decreasing it)? How strong is this effect?",
      "answer": "If people in society recognize, oh wow, I used to spend $1,000 a month just for health care. My prescriptions were $200 a month. Now my taxes went up, but only $5,000 a year, so I'm saving $700 a month, and every time I go to the doctor, it's completely free. Do you see that? If you can get people to understand that, the societal benefit of the changes in health, they will 100% support universal health care. Very positive effect. Definitely increase strongly their support."

So I hope that those small changes in messaging can cause a societal and cultural shift to the left in support for universal health care. I think it would take time. It would be a trickle effect. But the more people that you convince of this, the more people that hopefully they add to their boat and that boat grows and hopefully that movement causes an increased positive effect toward getting access to health care for all."

However, a few years ago that all changed and we no longer qualify for section 8 housing help. due to this we had to move because we couldn’t afford where we were living at anymore because we didn’t have the help anymore. That’s when we moved where we are currently living now. I needed a place that I could afford on my own without all the extra help. My landlord is amazing compared to my last landlord. She is great. One thing that I have definitely noticed Is how much my electricity bill keeps going up like each year literally, my last electric bill was over $1000 because we’re still paying off past due bills. I currently do get lie heap, which is where the government helps me pay my electric bill once a year and they only pay about. I think it was $300 this year. I only get that help one time During one month in the year. honestly, that electric bill is what makes it tough to be able to afford anything else including the price of groceries feels like the economy and all the things that go with it like our gas and our groceries and our healthcare medication’s all just keeps going up in price.",

That’s when we moved where we are currently living now. I needed a place that I could afford on my own without all the extra help. My landlord is amazing compared to my last landlord. She is great. One thing that I have definitely noticed Is how much my electricity bill keeps going up like each year literally, my last electric bill was over $1000 because we’re still paying off past due bills. I currently do get lie heap, which is where the government helps me pay my electric bill once a year and they only pay about. I think it was $300 this year. I only get that help one time During one month in the year. honestly, that electric bill is what makes it tough to be able to afford anything else including the price of groceries feels like the economy and all the things that go with it like our gas and our groceries and our healthcare medication’s all just keeps going up in price.",

However, broader social and economic policies, as well as a commitment to addressing systemic biases within the healthcare system, also play crucial roles. weakening social safety nets or rolling back universal access initiatives would likely lead to greater inequality.

That was a different experience because my rent was a lot lower, I received food stamps, which made me eligible to get section 8 housing help where they would pay some of my rent for me each month. However, a few years ago that all changed and we no longer qualify for section 8 housing help. due to this we had to move because we couldn’t afford where we were living at anymore because we didn’t have the help anymore. That’s when we moved where we are currently living now. I needed a place that I could afford on my own without all the extra help. My landlord is amazing compared to my last landlord. She is great. One thing that I have definitely noticed Is how much my electricity bill keeps going up like each year literally, my last electric bill was over $1000 because we’re still paying off past due bills. I currently do get lie heap, which is where the government helps me pay my electric bill once a year and they only pay about. I think it was $300 this year. I only get that help one time During one month in the year. honestly, that electric bill is what makes it tough to be able to afford anything else including the price of groceries feels like the economy and all the things that go with it like our gas and our groceries and our healthcare medication’s all just keeps going up in price.",

That was a different experience because my rent was a lot lower, I received food stamps, which made me eligible to get section 8 housing help where they would pay some of my rent for me each month. However, a few years ago that all changed and we no longer qualify for section 8 housing help. due to this we had to move because we couldn’t afford where we were living at anymore because we didn’t have the help anymore. That’s when we moved where we are currently living now. I needed a place that I could afford on my own without all the extra help. My landlord is amazing compared to my last landlord. She is great. One thing that I have definitely noticed Is how much my electricity bill keeps going up like each year literally, my last electric bill was over $1000 because we’re still paying off past due bills. I currently do get lie heap, which is where the government helps me pay my electric bill once a year and they only pay about. I think it was $300 this year. I only get that help one time During one month in the year. honestly, that electric bill is what makes it tough to be able to afford anything else including the price of groceries feels like the economy and all the things that go with it like our gas and our groceries and our healthcare medication’s all just keeps going up in price.",

Significant increases are more likely when there's a strong public consensus that the current system is failing and a compelling vision for a better, more equitable alternative emerges with strong political backing.

However, broader social and economic policies, as well as a commitment to addressing systemic biases within the healthcare system, also play crucial roles. weakening social safety nets or rolling back universal access initiatives would likely lead to greater inequality.

That was a different experience because my rent was a lot lower, I received food stamps, which made me eligible to get section 8 housing help where they would pay some of my rent for me each month. However, a few years ago that all changed and we no longer qualify for section 8 housing help. due to this we had to move because we couldn’t afford where we were living at anymore because we didn’t have the help anymore. That’s when we moved where we are currently living now. I needed a place that I could afford on my own without all the extra help. My landlord is amazing compared to my last landlord. She is great. One thing that I have definitely noticed Is how much my electricity bill keeps going up like each year literally, my last electric bill was over $1000 because we’re still paying off past due bills. I currently do get lie heap, which is where the government helps me pay my electric bill once a year and they only pay about. I think it was $300 this year. I only get that help one time During one month in the year. honestly, that electric bill is what makes it tough to be able to afford anything else including the price of groceries feels like the economy and all the things that go with it like our gas and our groceries and our healthcare medication’s all just keeps going up in price.",

However, a few years ago that all changed and we no longer qualify for section 8 housing help. due to this we had to move because we couldn’t afford where we were living at anymore because we didn’t have the help anymore. That’s when we moved where we are currently living now. I needed a place that I could afford on my own without all the extra help. My landlord is amazing compared to my last landlord. She is great. One thing that I have definitely noticed Is how much my electricity bill keeps going up like each year literally, my last electric bill was over $1000 because we’re still paying off past due bills.

That was a different experience because my rent was a lot lower, I received food stamps, which made me eligible to get section 8 housing help where they would pay some of my rent for me each month. However, a few years ago that all changed and we no longer qualify for section 8 housing help. due to this we had to move because we couldn’t afford where we were living at anymore because we didn’t have the help anymore. That’s when we moved where we are currently living now. I needed a place that I could afford on my own without all the extra help. My landlord is amazing compared to my last landlord. She is great. One thing that I have definitely noticed Is how much my electricity bill keeps going up like each year literally, my last electric bill was over $1000 because we’re still paying off past due bills. I currently do get lie heap, which is where the government helps me pay my electric bill once a year and they only pay about. I think it was $300 this year. I only get that help one time During one month in the year. honestly, that electric bill is what makes it tough to be able to afford anything else including the price of groceries feels like the economy and all the things that go with it like our gas and our groceries and our healthcare medication’s all just keeps going up in price.",

      "answer": "The path towards or away from universal healthcare in the US, including in Lewistown, will likely be shaped by a complex interplay of public demand, political will, economic conditions, the influence of powerful interest groups, and the effectiveness of arguments for and against it. Significant increases are more likely when there's a strong public consensus that the current system is failing and a compelling vision for a better, more equitable alternative emerges with strong political backing. Decreases in momentum can occur due to strong opposition, economic shifts, or a lack of sustained political will."

However, broader social and economic policies, as well as a commitment to addressing systemic biases within the healthcare system, also play crucial roles. weakening social safety nets or rolling back universal access initiatives would likely lead to greater inequality. The significance of these effects can range from slight to significant, with systemic policy changes having the most l impact."

      "answer": "The effect of public outcry for universal healthcare on support has not only already taken a long time to develop, but still seems to require more time. As for whether it's a positive or negative effect, it seems to be negative, because after all this time and after all these years, we still don't have policy enacting universal healthcare.

      "answer": "I think for the general public, it would take larger shifts. For the average Joe, a small shift would suffice.

It's important for these people, who the government can't function without, have access to healthcare, affordable healthcare. It's the lack of affordable healthcare that's led to the need of a universal healthcare system to begin with. These influences are negative, but for a positive reason."

      "answer": "The effect of public outcry for universal healthcare on support has not only already taken a long time to develop, but still seems to require more time. As for whether it's a positive or negative effect, it seems to be negative, because after all this time and after all these years, we still don't have policy enacting universal healthcare.

      "answer": "The effect of public outcry for universal healthcare on support has not only already taken a long time to develop, but still seems to require more time. As for whether it's a positive or negative effect, it seems to be negative, because after all this time and after all these years, we still don't have policy enacting universal healthcare. It's almost as if the higher the public outcry, the louder the public outcry, the less likely legislation will be passed to support universal healthcare."

If the institutions we have available to us are able to accommodate the health care needs of the general public, no significant changes should have to be made.

It's important for these people, who the government can't function without, have access to healthcare, affordable healthcare. It's the lack of affordable healthcare that's led to the need of a universal healthcare system to begin with. These influences are negative, but for a positive reason."

      "answer": "I believe it has a negative impact on those who don't need universal health care, as previously discussed. If you're a family who wasn't financially struggling, who wasn't experiencing a lack of access to health care, now your taxes will be higher, and essentially, you're going to be responsible for paying for someone else's health care that you don't need."

As we discussed earlier, despite the idea of universal healthcare being very positive to the average Joe, those who are in charge of enacting policy do not seem to agree.

      "answer": "The effect of public outcry for universal healthcare on support has not only already taken a long time to develop, but still seems to require more time. As for whether it's a positive or negative effect, it seems to be negative, because after all this time and after all these years, we still don't have policy enacting universal healthcare. It's almost as if the higher the public outcry, the louder the public outcry, the less likely legislation will be passed to support universal healthcare."

If the institutions we have available to us are able to accommodate the health care needs of the general public, no significant changes should have to be made. If there's a lack of access, even when cost isn't a factor, then we have a problem and big changes will be necessary."

The larger shifts are what's going to affect the court of public opinion."

      "answer": "When there is a little change in overall support for UHC, it is often followed by a clear increase in support for specific UHC-related policies. That means small changes in the overall way people feel about things can result in noticeable increases in UHC support.

      "answer": "The relationship between fairness in healthcare and support for universal healthcare is strong and positive.

      "answer": "The relationship between doctor compensation and support for universal healthcare is generally weak to moderate. If people believe compensation will be fair, it can have a positive effect by increasing support. But fears of pay cuts could have a negative effect. Overall, the effect is moderate and depends on public perception."

      "answer": "The relationship between fairness in healthcare and support for universal healthcare is strong and positive. When people believe the system is fair—meaning everyone gets access regardless of income or status—they are much more likely to support it.

When folks see it improving access and reducing out-of-pocket costs, they're more likely to back it. On the flip side, worries about higher taxes or overworked doctors can turn people off.

      "answer": "Access and support for universal healthcare are closely linked. When people see that more access means more people getting the care they need, support tends to grow.
