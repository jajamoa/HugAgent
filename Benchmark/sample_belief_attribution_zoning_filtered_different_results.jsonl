Of course, I'm thinking in terms of my own neighborhood, which I grew up in, and now after having returned from university, live in again, and it has always been single family neighborhoods in this whole area. I think there's an area with apartments further away, but it's the densest part of the city, and living there is kind of not the greatest. It's very stressful to try and find parking, and I know because I have friends that live there. Stores don't seem to be doing all that much better because so many more of them are open, so it kind of feels like the same thing, only it's just really hard to pick and choose where to go. I think that the biggest thing is it really would disrupt things. Change doesn't happen that rapidly. It happens very slowly, and those years of disruption would absolutely be very detrimental to the people living in this area, especially because there are lots of older people living here. So, I think that considering on a case-by-case basis, yes, there definitely are going to be some areas in which higher density housing would work, for instance, in bigger cities that already have higher density areas. But I think in even just generally urban, like not big cities, but like suburban areas, I do not think that it would work, and I would somewhat oppose it in those areas.

I think that those are the negative impacts. Positive, yes, rent would go down for sure. However, there are lots of places in which people don't rent their houses or apartments. So I think it would be really detrimental to property value, for instance, if people who own their houses, all of a sudden, they're going to be worth a lot less, it seems.

I worry about the kinds of people that might move in and worry that it might actually gentrify areas rather than make things more affordable. Of course I'm not very knowledgeable in what makes like a, there's a specific word for it, like a type of place where typically lower income people live, but even then I feel like making a specific part of the city like lower income can lead to a lot of problems like over-policing. I just don't see any real upsides to it. Even if things are made more affordable, I think that it's detrimental in many more areas that would definitely outtake that or overtake that."}, {"question_number": "4", "question": "What impact do you believe increased housing density might have on neighborhood character and quality of life?", "answer": "I think it would definitely absolutely change neighborhoods, especially in neighborhoods that have single-family housing. It feels like having far more people in an area that is not ready for that, there would have to be such an insane change of infrastructure. Like, even if one apartment complex was built in the area that I live in, for instance, the schools nearby would not be able to handle that. They're already at capacity. The city would need to be able to afford to accommodate very many more people, for one, because I'm sure people would move to places where it's more affordable. That's what always happens. I feel like quality of life would definitely go down. Again, there are some areas where lots of older people live, and having droves of new people come in and disrupt the flow of things the way that they are is extremely detrimental to people who have lived the same way for very many years. And while I understand that adaptability is important, and people should be able to adapt for the greater good, I don't see this as the greater good. I think that it would take years and years of the city's infrastructure changing in order to accommodate this, and it would be completely detrimental in the meanwhile, in those years of transition. And even then, there's no guaranteeing the city would come out for the better because of it.

However establishing public transportation in cities that don't Sounds Absolutely impossible. I know that in my city for instance. We do not have good public transportation like It's Seemingly impossible to the bus has never come in time People who are trying to commute to make it to things like school and work. It's just not going to work out There are plenty of people who opt to just walk to work because it's so much more viable Than to wait for the bus which is always late and overcrowded and has problems and delays I Think it would make it so much worse Significantly worse and congestion is already not great in cities that don't have big apartment complexes or Upzoning basically like here traffic is a nightmare in a lot of places because it's a city on the border So those border like the word to get to the border on the freeway is always ridiculously congested I can't imagine how terrible it would be. It would become like Los Angeles without even having that many people and There's no way we could establish Public transportation any more functionally without years and years of money and effort.

It's up to them to figure out zoning, because the public does not have a responsibility to be doing that, especially if I think the public would be opposed to that here. Yeah, we have areas with apartments for sure, but those areas tend to be older. They have things that are already established.

I think that upzoning would absolutely be detrimental to the environment, yes. Now that I didn't even consider that, now that I'm thinking about it, that sounds horrific. I worry that there will be a lot more gasoline needed as well in these areas, because people are definitely going to need cars if they wanna get anywhere in time. The oil, the electricity, the water that would be needed even, just it doesn't sound like it would be beneficial to the planet or the people."}, {"question_number": "8", "question": "What economic effects, both positive and negative, might result from changing zoning laws to allow more multi-family housing?", "answer": "This I'm less versed in. I don't understand what specific effects might happen, but I can make a couple of guesses maybe. I assume that more local businesses might be able to open up, but the thing is, I don't think that they would be able to compete with monopolies like Walmart or Sam's Club. Things like that. I still do think that local businesses would be wiped out just as easily as they have been. So I can't see very many positives aside from more money going to corporations, which is not a positive in my opinion. I suppose maybe it might benefit something economically for the city, like tax-wise perhaps or something. I can't imagine what. I'm thinking very hard about this and it's taking me a while to think. I'm trying to think of positives. I suppose maybe more professionals would be able to afford living in the city and that could be a net positive and maybe that would have an economic effect, but I really can't think of many positives. I suppose maybe, like was said, rent might become lower, but even with that, property values would go down it would seem. I don't think there are very many positives. There are certainly more net negatives."}, {"question_number": "9", "question": "How do you think the interests of current residents versus future residents should be balanced when making zoning decisions?", "answer": "I think the interests of current residents are certainly the most important. We cannot predict the future. We are not time travelers. Sure, we have people who are professionals who can look at patterns and think about how it might go, but we don't know that for certain. We should worry about the people who are living here now and their futures, not potential people who might be here someday. Because once we start thinking in hypotheticals, people are going to start thinking in the way that benefits them, and powerful people, in other words, typically richer people, are going to have more of a say in the future of places. So I think that it would not benefit the people who are already living somewhere to think of future residents' best interests. I think that we should absolutely highlight and focus on the struggles of current residents and their interests and what they need, because adding a bunch of extra people to something that's not entirely functioning just is a recipe for disaster."}, {"question_number": "10", "question": "What role do you think social equity and access to opportunity play in discussions about zoning and housing policy?", "answer": "Here it certainly gets more complicated in that yes, definitely people who can't afford to live somewhere need a place that's low income to live. I just don't think that that should be upzoning. I think that yes, low income housing should be established for sure. It would be very helpful. However, doing that in places that already have an established pattern, that already have an established presence, is detrimental to those places and to those people. It's not going to work. However, of course social equity plays a big amount and of course people have a right to have a place to live. People have a right to shelter, a right to food, a right to water, a right to the internet, a right to electricity. And upzoning areas that are already existing will not do that for them. I don't think so. It'll make everything harder for everybody. When it comes to social equity, I think it has everything to do with it and I think everybody deserves equal opportunity, which they won't get if we just start adding low income housing to areas that are already pre-existing. Areas need to be dictated for that or given for that. Again, very ideally by local government to see what would work the best.

But I can't see anybody wanting things to change like that. I can't see any of the neighborhoods nearby being able to function even remotely with that sort of change.

It definitely has a negative effect on how I would feel about upzoning because, for instance, my parents are in their late 60s to early 80s, like they are older. I can't see them being able to function that way. I can't see any of where the businesses they used to work at, I can't see that working. I understand that it's important for people to adapt, but I don't think people should have to adapt that significantly, especially in areas that are already established where people have owned homes for over 40, 50 years even. I don't think it's fair to shift things that significantly in established neighbourhoods, old local businesses that have somehow survived things like COVID and monopolies rising, corporations. It doesn't feel fair and it has a very strong effect on me and the way that I feel about it. I assume it would have a very strong effect on them and a very strong effect on their relatives, even relatives living elsewhere. Houses, even single family houses, are already crowded a lot of the time. It's a big family living in one house and the areas are crowded, the schools are crowded, the workplaces, it's already so hard to find a job. I can't see that many, I can't see it working.

And in areas where most people rent, it would be very beneficial. But in areas where most people own their houses, it has a negative effect. So it really just depends. It's a very strong effect in either a really good or a really bad way, depending on where this happens. In areas where most people rent, yes, upzoning would be great. It would make rent less for those people. And again, maybe it'll make property tax less in other areas, like family-owned houses, things like that. But it would also decrease the value of their property. So yeah, affordability kind of has everything to do with it. I think the biggest benefit would be being able to, for poorer people, for people of lower income, to afford a place to live. That's what's necessary. But we can't do it at the detriment of other people who are already established, because it would just lead to so many problems for everybody, including the low-income people moving in.

There's already an energy to it if that makes sense there's already something that people are used to and Change is not something very many people can adapt to very easily like yes We can adapt eventually, but is it something easy to adapt to absolutely not I? Think it would have a rather negative effect I can't see how adding an apartment complex for instance to an Area where there are pretty much just single-family houses Wouldn't not be totally out of place and have this sort of like new Congestion of traffic and new things opening up and everything changing I think the biggest issue is change and that does have a negative effect on things"}, {"question_number": "17", "question": "Is the effect of Public Transportation on Support for Upzoning immediate, or does it take time to develop?

It would be terrible. It absolutely takes time to develop a transportation system that works for adding so many new people to an area, especially if the point is to give lower income people a way to exist, a way to thrive. How would they do that without efficient public transportation? It would have an extremely negative effect because either they're going to have to figure out how to get a car. They're going to have to figure out a way to walk to where they need to be for work. They're going to have to figure out a way to walk to school because even the school bus system is out of whack in the area. There's going to have to be so much more.

I'm not generalizing here. I think it would be the last thing on people's mind, unfortunately. I would say it has a negative effect. I can't see it having a positive effect of any kind. It's not like more people has ever led to the environment becoming better in human history. To environmentalists, it would certainly decrease support. To general people, I don't think it would have an effect at all. So depending on the person and their morals and how much they care about ethicality and environmental protection, it either is a very strong effect in the negative sense, or for unfortunately, probably the majority or at least a very fair amount of people, it's not going to be something that they think about compared to all the other problems."}, {"question_number": "19", "question": "How confident are you that changes in Natural Gas Usage lead to changes in Support for Upzoning?

It's unfortunately not something that people think about. I would have the same answer as I did to the last question because to me these two answers are tied in. Natural gases are something that we expend and that we are eventually going to run out of and that's always been the case and people don't think about it or consider it. So yes, I think same answer.

I'm just saying in regards to monopolies that corporations like Walmart, Sam's, things that have already monopolized the industry, they exist and they're already rooting out small businesses. So I don't see how people coming in and opening up new small locally owned businesses would be beneficial to themselves because they might easily be like purged out or like culled by the big corporations in every city or they would just potentially become competition to the already existing and already struggling locally owned businesses that are here. That's what I meant by monopolies."}, {"question_number": "21", "question": "How confident are you that changes in Current residents' interests lead to changes in Support for Upzoning?

I think that's what I meant by that current residents interest is solving the current issues is necessary before we add more people to an area that's already dysfunctional or a city that's already dysfunctional. Things needs to be in a stable place before adding even more instability to it.

They have a right to food. They have a right to survive, a right to electricity, a right to warmth, a right to the internet these days with the way things work. Everyone has their basic human rights. And of course, giving people a place to live is important. I would say that would have a positive effect on the idea of upzoning because it's the only big benefit that I could see and I'm sure a lot of people could see is it would give people who can't afford a place to live and make affording to live easier for people who are struggling.

But if negative changes happen to them, if things change in their lives and there's more chaos and change added to it, then that would be a negative effect. And it would be pretty strong either way.

Adding even more to a certain area would totally overflow the school system. Like there would be no way to give attention to the kids who need it. There would be no way to have enough teachers. The classes are already so big, the sizes of the classes, I mean. And it would be immediate, especially if many people move in all at once. It would be a very negative effect. And I would say it's pretty strong. And this would be detrimental to both angry parents and kids who are not getting a proper education to begin with. It's such a poor school system already.

Please also indicate if these influences are positive (increasing) or negative (decreasing).", "answer": "I don't really understand this question either. The main cause of single-family neighborhoods are just that they were already pre-established to begin with. In the past, homes used to be affordable, so it made sense to live the typical quote-unquote American dream and get your white picket fence little home with a single earner earning all the income for a family and being able to support a family of four on just one income. That's not possible anymore. So I would say that the cause of single-family neighborhoods is a time before everything was as ridiculously priced as it is now. It's not feasible anymore, but it used to be at least somewhat feasible in the past. Now it's basically impossible to be able to do that. So the cause of it is just it's pre-established. It already existed decades and decades ago. I would say that these influences just are. I don't think it's a positive or negative influence on cities. I think that it's nice to have areas like that. It's certainly incredibly expensive to live there, and rent is impossible to afford there, but I don't think that adding to those neighborhoods something that will decrease them in value is beneficial to anybody.

Of course, I'm thinking in terms of my own neighborhood, which I grew up in, and now after having returned from university, live in again, and it has always been single family neighborhoods in this whole area. I think there's an area with apartments further away, but it's the densest part of the city, and living there is kind of not the greatest. It's very stressful to try and find parking, and I know because I have friends that live there. Stores don't seem to be doing all that much better because so many more of them are open, so it kind of feels like the same thing, only it's just really hard to pick and choose where to go. I think that the biggest thing is it really would disrupt things. Change doesn't happen that rapidly. It happens very slowly, and those years of disruption would absolutely be very detrimental to the people living in this area, especially because there are lots of older people living here. So, I think that considering on a case-by-case basis, yes, there definitely are going to be some areas in which higher density housing would work, for instance, in bigger cities that already have higher density areas. But I think in even just generally urban, like not big cities, but like suburban areas, I do not think that it would work, and I would somewhat oppose it in those areas.

It kind of feels like, even though I know it's going to be more affordable, it somewhat feels like it's going to completely change the area, and it'll take a very long time for it to get back to normal. I think that those are the negative impacts. Positive, yes, rent would go down for sure. However, there are lots of places in which people don't rent their houses or apartments.

I worry about the kinds of people that might move in and worry that it might actually gentrify areas rather than make things more affordable. Of course I'm not very knowledgeable in what makes like a, there's a specific word for it, like a type of place where typically lower income people live, but even then I feel like making a specific part of the city like lower income can lead to a lot of problems like over-policing.

Like, even if one apartment complex was built in the area that I live in, for instance, the schools nearby would not be able to handle that. They're already at capacity. The city would need to be able to afford to accommodate very many more people, for one, because I'm sure people would move to places where it's more affordable. That's what always happens. I feel like quality of life would definitely go down. Again, there are some areas where lots of older people live, and having droves of new people come in and disrupt the flow of things the way that they are is extremely detrimental to people who have lived the same way for very many years. And while I understand that adaptability is important, and people should be able to adapt for the greater good, I don't see this as the greater good. I think that it would take years and years of the city's infrastructure changing in order to accommodate this, and it would be completely detrimental in the meanwhile, in those years of transition.

I still do think that local businesses would be wiped out just as easily as they have been. So I can't see very many positives aside from more money going to corporations, which is not a positive in my opinion. I suppose maybe it might benefit something economically for the city, like tax-wise perhaps or something. I can't imagine what. I'm thinking very hard about this and it's taking me a while to think. I'm trying to think of positives. I suppose maybe more professionals would be able to afford living in the city and that could be a net positive and maybe that would have an economic effect, but I really can't think of many positives.

We should worry about the people who are living here now and their futures, not potential people who might be here someday. Because once we start thinking in hypotheticals, people are going to start thinking in the way that benefits them, and powerful people, in other words, typically richer people, are going to have more of a say in the future of places. So I think that it would not benefit the people who are already living somewhere to think of future residents' best interests.

I don't think so. It'll make everything harder for everybody.

Whereas if things happened in very little ways and slowly, perhaps the cities would be able to manage it better and the areas might be able to develop in time.

I don't think it's fair to shift things that significantly in established neighbourhoods, old local businesses that have somehow survived things like COVID and monopolies rising, corporations. It doesn't feel fair and it has a very strong effect on me and the way that I feel about it. I assume it would have a very strong effect on them and a very strong effect on their relatives, even relatives living elsewhere. Houses, even single family houses, are already crowded a lot of the time. It's a big family living in one house and the areas are crowded, the schools are crowded, the workplaces, it's already so hard to find a job. I can't see that many, I can't see it working. I can't see it being remotely beneficial for older people."}, {"question_number": "14", "question": "What causes changes in Support for Upzoning?

And in areas where most people rent, it would be very beneficial. But in areas where most people own their houses, it has a negative effect. So it really just depends. It's a very strong effect in either a really good or a really bad way, depending on where this happens. In areas where most people rent, yes, upzoning would be great. It would make rent less for those people. And again, maybe it'll make property tax less in other areas, like family-owned houses, things like that. But it would also decrease the value of their property. So yeah, affordability kind of has everything to do with it. I think the biggest benefit would be being able to, for poorer people, for people of lower income, to afford a place to live. That's what's necessary. But we can't do it at the detriment of other people who are already established, because it would just lead to so many problems for everybody, including the low-income people moving in.

There's already an energy to it if that makes sense there's already something that people are used to and Change is not something very many people can adapt to very easily like yes We can adapt eventually, but is it something easy to adapt to absolutely not I? Think it would have a rather negative effect I can't see how adding an apartment complex for instance to an Area where there are pretty much just single-family houses Wouldn't not be totally out of place and have this sort of like new Congestion of traffic and new things opening up and everything changing I think the biggest issue is change and that does have a negative effect on things"}, {"question_number": "17", "question": "Is the effect of Public Transportation on Support for Upzoning immediate, or does it take time to develop?

It would be terrible. It absolutely takes time to develop a transportation system that works for adding so many new people to an area, especially if the point is to give lower income people a way to exist, a way to thrive. How would they do that without efficient public transportation? It would have an extremely negative effect because either they're going to have to figure out how to get a car. They're going to have to figure out a way to walk to where they need to be for work. They're going to have to figure out a way to walk to school because even the school bus system is out of whack in the area. There's going to have to be so much more.

How strong is this effect?", "answer": "I mean, a lot of people are blind to environmental concerns to begin with, while it's very important to me, I think it would be the last thing on everybody else's mind for most people's minds. I'm not generalizing here. I think it would be the last thing on people's mind, unfortunately. I would say it has a negative effect. I can't see it having a positive effect of any kind. It's not like more people has ever led to the environment becoming better in human history. To environmentalists, it would certainly decrease support. To general people, I don't think it would have an effect at all. So depending on the person and their morals and how much they care about ethicality and environmental protection, it either is a very strong effect in the negative sense, or for unfortunately, probably the majority or at least a very fair amount of people, it's not going to be something that they think about compared to all the other problems."}, {"question_number": "19", "question": "How confident are you that changes in Natural Gas Usage lead to changes in Support for Upzoning?

It's unfortunately not something that people think about. I would have the same answer as I did to the last question because to me these two answers are tied in. Natural gases are something that we expend and that we are eventually going to run out of and that's always been the case and people don't think about it or consider it. So yes, I think same answer.

I'm just saying in regards to monopolies that corporations like Walmart, Sam's, things that have already monopolized the industry, they exist and they're already rooting out small businesses. So I don't see how people coming in and opening up new small locally owned businesses would be beneficial to themselves because they might easily be like purged out or like culled by the big corporations in every city or they would just potentially become competition to the already existing and already struggling locally owned businesses that are here. That's what I meant by monopolies."}, {"question_number": "21", "question": "How confident are you that changes in Current residents' interests lead to changes in Support for Upzoning?

How strong is this effect?", "answer": "I mean I feel like if current residents had less things to strive for or hope for or changes that they would need then perhaps it would be easier to accept upzoning. I think that's what I meant by that current residents interest is solving the current issues is necessary before we add more people to an area that's already dysfunctional or a city that's already dysfunctional. Things needs to be in a stable place before adding even more instability to it. So I would say it has a pretty strong effect because content people are more likely to accept change than people who are already having a hard time or are already angry about something."}, {"question_number": "22", "question": "How would you describe the relationship between Right to Shelter and Support for Upzoning?

They have a right to food. They have a right to survive, a right to electricity, a right to warmth, a right to the internet these days with the way things work. Everyone has their basic human rights. And of course, giving people a place to live is important. I would say that would have a positive effect on the idea of upzoning because it's the only big benefit that I could see and I'm sure a lot of people could see is it would give people who can't afford a place to live and make affording to live easier for people who are struggling.

Do negative effects on population and economy have a positive or negative effect on support? Well, there are negative effects. So of course, they have a negative effect.

I mean, I feel like as long as areas where, if already pre-established areas where lots of people who have been living here for a long time live remain untouched, that might lead to more support. But if negative changes happen to them, if things change in their lives and there's more chaos and change added to it, then that would be a negative effect. And it would be pretty strong either way. So again, not a super clear question, but that's the answer I think I can give."}, {"question_number": "25", "question": "Is the effect of School capacity on Support for Upzoning immediate, or does it take time to develop?

Schools are already really full and there are not enough teachers generally all over the nation. So it's very hard already to deal with how many kids are in so many schools that already exist here. Adding even more to a certain area would totally overflow the school system. Like there would be no way to give attention to the kids who need it. There would be no way to have enough teachers. The classes are already so big, the sizes of the classes, I mean. And it would be immediate, especially if many people move in all at once. It would be a very negative effect. And I would say it's pretty strong. And this would be detrimental to both angry parents and kids who are not getting a proper education to begin with. It's such a poor school system already.

Please also indicate if these influences are positive (increasing) or negative (decreasing).", "answer": "I don't really understand this question either. The main cause of single-family neighborhoods are just that they were already pre-established to begin with. In the past, homes used to be affordable, so it made sense to live the typical quote-unquote American dream and get your white picket fence little home with a single earner earning all the income for a family and being able to support a family of four on just one income. That's not possible anymore. So I would say that the cause of single-family neighborhoods is a time before everything was as ridiculously priced as it is now. It's not feasible anymore, but it used to be at least somewhat feasible in the past. Now it's basically impossible to be able to do that. So the cause of it is just it's pre-established. It already existed decades and decades ago. I would say that these influences just are. I don't think it's a positive or negative influence on cities. I think that it's nice to have areas like that. It's certainly incredibly expensive to live there, and rent is impossible to afford there, but I don't think that adding to those neighborhoods something that will decrease them in value is beneficial to anybody.

Of course, I'm thinking in terms of my own neighborhood, which I grew up in, and now after having returned from university, live in again, and it has always been single family neighborhoods in this whole area. I think there's an area with apartments further away, but it's the densest part of the city, and living there is kind of not the greatest. It's very stressful to try and find parking, and I know because I have friends that live there. Stores don't seem to be doing all that much better because so many more of them are open, so it kind of feels like the same thing, only it's just really hard to pick and choose where to go. I think that the biggest thing is it really would disrupt things. Change doesn't happen that rapidly. It happens very slowly, and those years of disruption would absolutely be very detrimental to the people living in this area, especially because there are lots of older people living here. So, I think that considering on a case-by-case basis, yes, there definitely are going to be some areas in which higher density housing would work, for instance, in bigger cities that already have higher density areas. But I think in even just generally urban, like not big cities, but like suburban areas, I do not think that it would work, and I would somewhat oppose it in those areas.

It kind of feels like, even though I know it's going to be more affordable, it somewhat feels like it's going to completely change the area, and it'll take a very long time for it to get back to normal. I think that those are the negative impacts. Positive, yes, rent would go down for sure. However, there are lots of places in which people don't rent their houses or apartments. So I think it would be really detrimental to property value, for instance, if people who own their houses, all of a sudden, they're going to be worth a lot less, it seems.

I worry about the kinds of people that might move in and worry that it might actually gentrify areas rather than make things more affordable. Of course I'm not very knowledgeable in what makes like a, there's a specific word for it, like a type of place where typically lower income people live, but even then I feel like making a specific part of the city like lower income can lead to a lot of problems like over-policing.

It feels like having far more people in an area that is not ready for that, there would have to be such an insane change of infrastructure. Like, even if one apartment complex was built in the area that I live in, for instance, the schools nearby would not be able to handle that. They're already at capacity. The city would need to be able to afford to accommodate very many more people, for one, because I'm sure people would move to places where it's more affordable. That's what always happens. I feel like quality of life would definitely go down. Again, there are some areas where lots of older people live, and having droves of new people come in and disrupt the flow of things the way that they are is extremely detrimental to people who have lived the same way for very many years. And while I understand that adaptability is important, and people should be able to adapt for the greater good, I don't see this as the greater good. I think that it would take years and years of the city's infrastructure changing in order to accommodate this, and it would be completely detrimental in the meanwhile, in those years of transition.

We do not have good public transportation like It's Seemingly impossible to the bus has never come in time People who are trying to commute to make it to things like school and work. It's just not going to work out There are plenty of people who opt to just walk to work because it's so much more viable Than to wait for the bus which is always late and overcrowded and has problems and delays I Think it would make it so much worse Significantly worse and congestion is already not great in cities that don't have big apartment complexes or Upzoning basically like here traffic is a nightmare in a lot of places because it's a city on the border So those border like the word to get to the border on the freeway is always ridiculously congested I can't imagine how terrible it would be.

It's up to them to figure out zoning, because the public does not have a responsibility to be doing that, especially if I think the public would be opposed to that here. Yeah, we have areas with apartments for sure, but those areas tend to be older. They have things that are already established.

I assume that more local businesses might be able to open up, but the thing is, I don't think that they would be able to compete with monopolies like Walmart or Sam's Club. Things like that. I still do think that local businesses would be wiped out just as easily as they have been. So I can't see very many positives aside from more money going to corporations, which is not a positive in my opinion. I suppose maybe it might benefit something economically for the city, like tax-wise perhaps or something. I can't imagine what. I'm thinking very hard about this and it's taking me a while to think. I'm trying to think of positives. I suppose maybe more professionals would be able to afford living in the city and that could be a net positive and maybe that would have an economic effect, but I really can't think of many positives. I suppose maybe, like was said, rent might become lower, but even with that, property values would go down it would seem. I don't think there are very many positives.

We cannot predict the future. We are not time travelers. Sure, we have people who are professionals who can look at patterns and think about how it might go, but we don't know that for certain. We should worry about the people who are living here now and their futures, not potential people who might be here someday. Because once we start thinking in hypotheticals, people are going to start thinking in the way that benefits them, and powerful people, in other words, typically richer people, are going to have more of a say in the future of places. So I think that it would not benefit the people who are already living somewhere to think of future residents' best interests.

I just don't think that that should be upzoning. I think that yes, low income housing should be established for sure. It would be very helpful. However, doing that in places that already have an established pattern, that already have an established presence, is detrimental to those places and to those people. It's not going to work. However, of course social equity plays a big amount and of course people have a right to have a place to live. People have a right to shelter, a right to food, a right to water, a right to the internet, a right to electricity. And upzoning areas that are already existing will not do that for them. I don't think so. It'll make everything harder for everybody. When it comes to social equity, I think it has everything to do with it and I think everybody deserves equal opportunity, which they won't get if we just start adding low income housing to areas that are already pre-existing. Areas need to be dictated for that or given for that. Again, very ideally by local government to see what would work the best.

I think that larger shifts would be very detrimental to the population and the economy and just generally everything here. At least here in my city, I'm considering it from a bigger lens as best I can. I think that smaller changes would probably lead for more support or rather less negativity. I think that if things happened very fast, the negative changes would be very noticeable. Whereas if things happened in very little ways and slowly, perhaps the cities would be able to manage it better and the areas might be able to develop in time. And perhaps people won't realize things are getting worse if they do as quickly. Because people are able to turn a blind eye to things as long as they are doing okay a lot of the time. So it's like people might be blissfully ignorant if it's not affecting them.

And in areas where most people rent, it would be very beneficial. But in areas where most people own their houses, it has a negative effect. So it really just depends. It's a very strong effect in either a really good or a really bad way, depending on where this happens. In areas where most people rent, yes, upzoning would be great. It would make rent less for those people. And again, maybe it'll make property tax less in other areas, like family-owned houses, things like that. But it would also decrease the value of their property. So yeah, affordability kind of has everything to do with it.

It absolutely takes time to develop a transportation system that works for adding so many new people to an area, especially if the point is to give lower income people a way to exist, a way to thrive. How would they do that without efficient public transportation? It would have an extremely negative effect because either they're going to have to figure out how to get a car. They're going to have to figure out a way to walk to where they need to be for work.

I'm not generalizing here. I think it would be the last thing on people's mind, unfortunately. I would say it has a negative effect. I can't see it having a positive effect of any kind. It's not like more people has ever led to the environment becoming better in human history. To environmentalists, it would certainly decrease support. To general people, I don't think it would have an effect at all. So depending on the person and their morals and how much they care about ethicality and environmental protection, it either is a very strong effect in the negative sense, or for unfortunately, probably the majority or at least a very fair amount of people, it's not going to be something that they think about compared to all the other problems."}, {"question_number": "19", "question": "How confident are you that changes in Natural Gas Usage lead to changes in Support for Upzoning?

It's unfortunately not something that people think about. I would have the same answer as I did to the last question because to me these two answers are tied in. Natural gases are something that we expend and that we are eventually going to run out of and that's always been the case and people don't think about it or consider it. So yes, I think same answer.

I'm just saying in regards to monopolies that corporations like Walmart, Sam's, things that have already monopolized the industry, they exist and they're already rooting out small businesses. So I don't see how people coming in and opening up new small locally owned businesses would be beneficial to themselves because they might easily be like purged out or like culled by the big corporations in every city or they would just potentially become competition to the already existing and already struggling locally owned businesses that are here. That's what I meant by monopolies."}, {"question_number": "21", "question": "How confident are you that changes in Current residents' interests lead to changes in Support for Upzoning?

I think that's what I meant by that current residents interest is solving the current issues is necessary before we add more people to an area that's already dysfunctional or a city that's already dysfunctional. Things needs to be in a stable place before adding even more instability to it.

They have a right to food. They have a right to survive, a right to electricity, a right to warmth, a right to the internet these days with the way things work. Everyone has their basic human rights. And of course, giving people a place to live is important. I would say that would have a positive effect on the idea of upzoning because it's the only big benefit that I could see and I'm sure a lot of people could see is it would give people who can't afford a place to live and make affording to live easier for people who are struggling.

Do negative effects on population and economy have a positive or negative effect on support? Well, there are negative effects. So of course, they have a negative effect.

I mean, I feel like as long as areas where, if already pre-established areas where lots of people who have been living here for a long time live remain untouched, that might lead to more support. But if negative changes happen to them, if things change in their lives and there's more chaos and change added to it, then that would be a negative effect. And it would be pretty strong either way.

Schools are already really full and there are not enough teachers generally all over the nation. So it's very hard already to deal with how many kids are in so many schools that already exist here. Adding even more to a certain area would totally overflow the school system. Like there would be no way to give attention to the kids who need it. There would be no way to have enough teachers. The classes are already so big, the sizes of the classes, I mean. And it would be immediate, especially if many people move in all at once. It would be a very negative effect. And I would say it's pretty strong. And this would be detrimental to both angry parents and kids who are not getting a proper education to begin with. It's such a poor school system already.

Please also indicate if these influences are positive (increasing) or negative (decreasing).", "answer": "I don't really understand this question either. The main cause of single-family neighborhoods are just that they were already pre-established to begin with. In the past, homes used to be affordable, so it made sense to live the typical quote-unquote American dream and get your white picket fence little home with a single earner earning all the income for a family and being able to support a family of four on just one income. That's not possible anymore. So I would say that the cause of single-family neighborhoods is a time before everything was as ridiculously priced as it is now. It's not feasible anymore, but it used to be at least somewhat feasible in the past. Now it's basically impossible to be able to do that. So the cause of it is just it's pre-established. It already existed decades and decades ago. I would say that these influences just are. I don't think it's a positive or negative influence on cities. I think that it's nice to have areas like that. It's certainly incredibly expensive to live there, and rent is impossible to afford there, but I don't think that adding to those neighborhoods something that will decrease them in value is beneficial to anybody.

Of course, I'm thinking in terms of my own neighborhood, which I grew up in, and now after having returned from university, live in again, and it has always been single family neighborhoods in this whole area. I think there's an area with apartments further away, but it's the densest part of the city, and living there is kind of not the greatest. It's very stressful to try and find parking, and I know because I have friends that live there. Stores don't seem to be doing all that much better because so many more of them are open, so it kind of feels like the same thing, only it's just really hard to pick and choose where to go. I think that the biggest thing is it really would disrupt things. Change doesn't happen that rapidly. It happens very slowly, and those years of disruption would absolutely be very detrimental to the people living in this area, especially because there are lots of older people living here. So, I think that considering on a case-by-case basis, yes, there definitely are going to be some areas in which higher density housing would work, for instance, in bigger cities that already have higher density areas. But I think in even just generally urban, like not big cities, but like suburban areas, I do not think that it would work, and I would somewhat oppose it in those areas.

It kind of feels like, even though I know it's going to be more affordable, it somewhat feels like it's going to completely change the area, and it'll take a very long time for it to get back to normal. I think that those are the negative impacts. Positive, yes, rent would go down for sure. However, there are lots of places in which people don't rent their houses or apartments. So I think it would be really detrimental to property value, for instance, if people who own their houses, all of a sudden, they're going to be worth a lot less, it seems.

I worry about the kinds of people that might move in and worry that it might actually gentrify areas rather than make things more affordable. Of course I'm not very knowledgeable in what makes like a, there's a specific word for it, like a type of place where typically lower income people live, but even then I feel like making a specific part of the city like lower income can lead to a lot of problems like over-policing.

It feels like having far more people in an area that is not ready for that, there would have to be such an insane change of infrastructure. Like, even if one apartment complex was built in the area that I live in, for instance, the schools nearby would not be able to handle that. They're already at capacity. The city would need to be able to afford to accommodate very many more people, for one, because I'm sure people would move to places where it's more affordable. That's what always happens. I feel like quality of life would definitely go down. Again, there are some areas where lots of older people live, and having droves of new people come in and disrupt the flow of things the way that they are is extremely detrimental to people who have lived the same way for very many years. And while I understand that adaptability is important, and people should be able to adapt for the greater good, I don't see this as the greater good. I think that it would take years and years of the city's infrastructure changing in order to accommodate this, and it would be completely detrimental in the meanwhile, in those years of transition.

We do not have good public transportation like It's Seemingly impossible to the bus has never come in time People who are trying to commute to make it to things like school and work. It's just not going to work out There are plenty of people who opt to just walk to work because it's so much more viable Than to wait for the bus which is always late and overcrowded and has problems and delays I Think it would make it so much worse Significantly worse and congestion is already not great in cities that don't have big apartment complexes or Upzoning basically like here traffic is a nightmare in a lot of places because it's a city on the border So those border like the word to get to the border on the freeway is always ridiculously congested I can't imagine how terrible it would be. It would become like Los Angeles without even having that many people and There's no way we could establish Public transportation any more functionally without years and years of money and effort.

It's up to them to figure out zoning, because the public does not have a responsibility to be doing that, especially if I think the public would be opposed to that here. Yeah, we have areas with apartments for sure, but those areas tend to be older. They have things that are already established.

I assume that more local businesses might be able to open up, but the thing is, I don't think that they would be able to compete with monopolies like Walmart or Sam's Club. Things like that. I still do think that local businesses would be wiped out just as easily as they have been. So I can't see very many positives aside from more money going to corporations, which is not a positive in my opinion. I suppose maybe it might benefit something economically for the city, like tax-wise perhaps or something. I can't imagine what. I'm thinking very hard about this and it's taking me a while to think. I'm trying to think of positives. I suppose maybe more professionals would be able to afford living in the city and that could be a net positive and maybe that would have an economic effect, but I really can't think of many positives. I suppose maybe, like was said, rent might become lower, but even with that, property values would go down it would seem. I don't think there are very many positives.

We cannot predict the future. We are not time travelers. Sure, we have people who are professionals who can look at patterns and think about how it might go, but we don't know that for certain. We should worry about the people who are living here now and their futures, not potential people who might be here someday. Because once we start thinking in hypotheticals, people are going to start thinking in the way that benefits them, and powerful people, in other words, typically richer people, are going to have more of a say in the future of places. So I think that it would not benefit the people who are already living somewhere to think of future residents' best interests.

I just don't think that that should be upzoning. I think that yes, low income housing should be established for sure. It would be very helpful. However, doing that in places that already have an established pattern, that already have an established presence, is detrimental to those places and to those people. It's not going to work. However, of course social equity plays a big amount and of course people have a right to have a place to live. People have a right to shelter, a right to food, a right to water, a right to the internet, a right to electricity. And upzoning areas that are already existing will not do that for them. I don't think so. It'll make everything harder for everybody. When it comes to social equity, I think it has everything to do with it and I think everybody deserves equal opportunity, which they won't get if we just start adding low income housing to areas that are already pre-existing. Areas need to be dictated for that or given for that. Again, very ideally by local government to see what would work the best.

I think that larger shifts would be very detrimental to the population and the economy and just generally everything here. At least here in my city, I'm considering it from a bigger lens as best I can. I think that smaller changes would probably lead for more support or rather less negativity. I think that if things happened very fast, the negative changes would be very noticeable. Whereas if things happened in very little ways and slowly, perhaps the cities would be able to manage it better and the areas might be able to develop in time. And perhaps people won't realize things are getting worse if they do as quickly. Because people are able to turn a blind eye to things as long as they are doing okay a lot of the time. So it's like people might be blissfully ignorant if it's not affecting them. Whereas if there are these big things, then there will be a lot of people talking about it all at once very vocally and more people will be aware of it.

How strong is this effect?", "answer": "I mean, a lot of people are blind to environmental concerns to begin with, while it's very important to me, I think it would be the last thing on everybody else's mind for most people's minds. I'm not generalizing here. I think it would be the last thing on people's mind, unfortunately. I would say it has a negative effect. I can't see it having a positive effect of any kind. It's not like more people has ever led to the environment becoming better in human history. To environmentalists, it would certainly decrease support. To general people, I don't think it would have an effect at all. So depending on the person and their morals and how much they care about ethicality and environmental protection, it either is a very strong effect in the negative sense, or for unfortunately, probably the majority or at least a very fair amount of people, it's not going to be something that they think about compared to all the other problems."}, {"question_number": "19", "question": "How confident are you that changes in Natural Gas Usage lead to changes in Support for Upzoning? Does it have a positive effect (increasing it) or a negative effect (decreasing it)? How strong is this effect?", "answer": "I think that this goes hand-in-hand with environmental issues. It's unfortunately not something that people think about. I would have the same answer as I did to the last question because to me these two answers are tied in. Natural gases are something that we expend and that we are eventually going to run out of and that's always been the case and people don't think about it or consider it. So yes, I think same answer. Depending on how environmentally ethical you are, it either has a strong negative effect or other people won't even think about it."}, {"question_number": "20", "question": "How confident are you that changes in Monopolies lead to changes in Support for Upzoning? Does it have a positive effect (increasing it) or a negative effect (decreasing it)? How strong is this effect?", "answer": "I don't understand what changes in monopolies means. I'm just saying in regards to monopolies that corporations like Walmart, Sam's, things that have already monopolized the industry, they exist and they're already rooting out small businesses. So I don't see how people coming in and opening up new small locally owned businesses would be beneficial to themselves because they might easily be like purged out or like culled by the big corporations in every city or they would just potentially become competition to the already existing and already struggling locally owned businesses that are here. That's what I meant by monopolies."}, {"question_number": "21", "question": "How confident are you that changes in Current residents' interests lead to changes in Support for Upzoning? Does it have a positive effect (increasing it) or a negative effect (decreasing it)? How strong is this effect?", "answer": "I mean I feel like if current residents had less things to strive for or hope for or changes that they would need then perhaps it would be easier to accept upzoning. I think that's what I meant by that current residents interest is solving the current issues is necessary before we add more people to an area that's already dysfunctional or a city that's already dysfunctional. Things needs to be in a stable place before adding even more instability to it. So I would say it has a pretty strong effect because content people are more likely to accept change than people who are already having a hard time or are already angry about something."}, {"question_number": "22", "question": "How would you describe the relationship between Right to Shelter and Support for Upzoning? Is it a strong or weak connection? Does it have a positive effect (increasing it) or a negative effect (decreasing it)? How strong is this effect?", "answer": "Oh, it's an extremely strong connection. Every human being has a right to live. They have a right to shelter. They have a right to water. They have a right to food. They have a right to survive, a right to electricity, a right to warmth, a right to the internet these days with the way things work. Everyone has their basic human rights. And of course, giving people a place to live is important. I would say that would have a positive effect on the idea of upzoning because it's the only big benefit that I could see and I'm sure a lot of people could see is it would give people who can't afford a place to live and make affording to live easier for people who are struggling. So it's a very strong effect. It's the one big positive that exists in all this."}, {"question_number": "23", "question": "Does Negative effects on population and economy have a positive or negative effect on Support for Upzoning, and how significant is this effect? Does it have a positive effect (increasing it) or a negative effect (decreasing it)? How strong is this effect?", "answer": "that this question answers itself. Do negative effects on population and economy have a positive or negative effect on support? Well, there are negative effects. So of course, they have a negative effect. I think that this is an extended question that didn't really come out quite right, or maybe wasn't necessary to ask because this is already, it answers itself."}, {"question_number": "24", "question": "How confident are you that changes in Older residents lead to changes in Support for Upzoning? Does it have a positive effect (increasing it) or a negative effect (decreasing it)? How strong is this effect?", "answer": "I don't really understand what changes in older residence means. I mean, I feel like as long as areas where, if already pre-established areas where lots of people who have been living here for a long time live remain untouched, that might lead to more support. But if negative changes happen to them, if things change in their lives and there's more chaos and change added to it, then that would be a negative effect. And it would be pretty strong either way. So again, not a super clear question, but that's the answer I think I can give."}, {"question_number": "25", "question": "Is the effect of School capacity on Support for Upzoning immediate, or does it take time to develop? Does it have a positive effect (increasing it) or a negative effect (decreasing it)? How strong is this effect?", "answer": "Oh, this is for sure an immediate concern. Schools are already really full and there are not enough teachers generally all over the nation. So it's very hard already to deal with how many kids are in so many schools that already exist here. Adding even more to a certain area would totally overflow the school system. Like there would be no way to give attention to the kids who need it. There would be no way to have enough teachers. The classes are already so big, the sizes of the classes, I mean. And it would be immediate, especially if many people move in all at once. It would be a very negative effect. And I would say it's pretty strong. And this would be detrimental to both angry parents and kids who are not getting a proper education to begin with. It's such a poor school system already. Adding even more weights to something that's breaking is not going to be efficient or effective or good."}, {"question_number": "26", "question": "What do you think are the main causes of Single-family neighborhoods, and how certain are you about these relationships? Please also indicate if these influences are positive (increasing) or negative (decreasing).", "answer": "I don't really understand this question either. The main cause of single-family neighborhoods are just that they were already pre-established to begin with. In the past, homes used to be affordable, so it made sense to live the typical quote-unquote American dream and get your white picket fence little home with a single earner earning all the income for a family and being able to support a family of four on just one income. That's not possible anymore. So I would say that the cause of single-family neighborhoods is a time before everything was as ridiculously priced as it is now. It's not feasible anymore, but it used to be at least somewhat feasible in the past. Now it's basically impossible to be able to do that. So the cause of it is just it's pre-established. It already existed decades and decades ago. I would say that these influences just are. I don't think it's a positive or negative influence on cities. I think that it's nice to have areas like that. It's certainly incredibly expensive to live there, and rent is impossible to afford there, but I don't think that adding to those neighborhoods something that will decrease them in value is beneficial to anybody.

It has become a massive problem over the last seven years. They are building tons of apartment complexes, and they are now starting to upzone, like our Costco is upzoning. The effect on traffic congestion is extremely significant. It definitely decreases support for upzoning, I think, for obvious reasons. One of the main reasons."}, {"question_number": "15", "question": "How would you describe the relationship between Local government role and Support for Upzoning? Is it a strong or weak connection? Does it have a positive effect (increasing it) or a negative effect (decreasing it)? How strong is this effect?", "answer": "The relationship between local government and support for upzoning is direct. I feel like there must be kickbacks or something because our local government completely ignores everyone who lives here, every one of our voices. They completely tune us out and they just approve everything. Tons of gas stations, tons of liquor stores, tons of apartment complexes that literally none of us want. It's a pretty strong connection between local government and upzoning support."}, {"question_number": "16", "question": "How confident are you that changes in Public opposition lead to changes in Support for Upzoning? Does it have a positive effect (increasing it) or a negative effect (decreasing it)? How strong is this effect?", "answer": "Well, the public are the ones who have to live with these upzoning changes. So if you don't have public support for upzoning, you're going to have public opposition. They are inverse of each other. Make it affordable, somehow decrease traffic, and you would increase public support. But that's not what they're doing. It's going to remain negative."}, {"question_number": "17", "question": "Is the effect of Increased population density on Support for Upzoning immediate, or does it take time to develop? Does it have a positive effect (increasing it) or a negative effect (decreasing it)? How strong is this effect?", "answer": "I think the effect is pretty immediate. You know, you build 10 apartment complexes, each one holds 200 apartments, and bam, that's all in a three-mile area. Now guess what? People are living there and driving from there. They're all on the roads with us and they weren't here a year ago. That's definitely going to have a negative effect on support. Population density is an issue."}, {"question_number": "18", "question": "How would you describe the relationship between Property taxes and Support for Upzoning? Is it a strong or weak connection? Does it have a positive effect (increasing it) or a negative effect (decreasing it)? How strong is this effect?", "answer": "Strong connection. For sure our property taxes are crazy high. They are building all this crap and our property taxes still go up every year. They haven't lowered them at all even though they're bringing in millions more with all the housing that they've built and filled. It's really not fair and they do nothing about it even though we all do use our voice."}, {"question_number": "20", "question": "How would you describe the relationship between Luxury Apartments and Support for Upzoning? Is it a strong or weak connection? Does it have a positive effect (increasing it) or a negative effect (decreasing it)? How strong is this effect?", "answer": "I think obviously luxury apartments are more desirable to look at and have in your community than cheaper apartments or builder grade everything or government housing. I don't think any of these have a positive effect. None of these things are wanted where I live. So I'm not I'm not really sure how you would improve on that when people don't want this. We prefer single-family homes. I don't know why we can't build normal starter single-family homes like we used to back when boomers were buying homes. Why does everything have to be crammed all together?"}, {"question_number": "21", "question": "Is the effect of Affordability of Homes on Support for Upzoning immediate, or does it take time to develop? Does it have a positive effect (increasing it) or a negative effect (decreasing it)? How strong is this effect?", "answer": "I don't think anyone believes this is going to make housing more affordable. This is just a lie they tell us to get this stuff passed and pushed through. The reason I say that is because they have built a crap ton of apartment complexes in my county over the past few years, but home prices and apartment rentals have all gone up and property taxes have continued to go up. So they're saying that it's going to affect the affordability of homes in a positive way is not truthful. No one trusts it and it's not going to build support because we know we're being lied to."}, {"question_number": "22", "question": "How would you describe the relationship between Immediate effects and Support for Upzoning? Is it a strong or weak connection? Does it have a positive effect (increasing it) or a negative effect (decreasing it)? How strong is this effect?", "answer": "Immediate effects, if they're positive, probably increase support for upzoning. But overall, I just think it's a negative. It's not something that the suburbs wanted. We don't live in a giant city. We didn't want our suburbs to become that way. So it's a negative effect overall, regardless of how they spin it."}, {"question_number": "23", "question": "How would you describe the relationship between Upzoning support and Support for Upzoning? Is it a strong or weak connection? Does it have a positive effect (increasing it) or a negative effect (decreasing it)? How strong is this effect?", "answer": "I don't understand that question, the relationship between upzoning support and support for upzoning. I guess they're inverse, right? Because people don't want it."}, {"question_number": "24", "question": "What do you think are the main causes of Upzoning policies, and how certain are you about these relationships? Please also indicate if these influences are positive (increasing) or negative (decreasing).", "answer": "I think the main causes are money. They must get a lot of money for the city when they pass this stuff and let these things be built. I don't know what the transparency is on that. I've not looked it up, but I assume there must be a positive for government officials who say yes to this stuff or they wouldn't say yes to everything. Like they live in these communities too. They can drive the streets and see that it's not desirable to have this stuff, so I'm not really sure why all the yes. I'm not sure what is the main cause if not money or gain in some way."}, {"question_number": "25", "question": "How confident are you that changes in Negative effect lead to changes in Support for Upzoning? Does it have a positive effect (increasing it) or a negative effect (decreasing it)? How strong is this effect?", "answer": "Negative effects absolutely lead to less support for upzoning. I'm very confident in that. You know, more traffic, that's a negative. Lessened support. More trash on the roads, potentially more crime. Schools are now too full and so your kid has to go to class in an un-air-conditioned trailer because their school can't hold the number of new, the number of students who've come since we've built all this. Negative effects definitely decrease support. Positive effects would increase support."}, {"question_number": "26", "question": "Does Population density have a positive or negative effect on Support for Upzoning, and how significant is this effect? Does it have a positive effect (increasing it) or a negative effect (decreasing it)? How strong is this effect?", "answer": "Population density is definitely an issue. I don't see how packing even more people into a smaller area with up zoning is going to help that problem. So I don't really understand why they word it that way. It's not, you know, these people don't live here now. You're building all this stuff to bring them here. I think there's other ways that we could deal with population density and the lack of affordable housing. There's other ways to do this besides this model."}], "context_length": "long", "topic": "zoning", "task_type": "belief_attribution", "task_question": "How much does community involvement affect support for building more housing according to this person?", "answer_options": {"A": "POSITIVE effect", "B": "NEGATIVE effect"}, "answer": "B", "source_qa": {"question_number": "Q19", "question": "Would small changes in Town hall participation lead to noticeable changes in Support for Upzoning, or would it take larger shifts?

But I can see how allowing more more housing could bring prices down a bit. more apartments or more townhouses could mean more options for people who can\u2019t afford a family home in the big city! But then again if everyone wanted to live in those areas the demands might still keep those prices up. It\u2019s tricky in my opinion ."}, {"question_number": "4", "question": "What impact do you believe increased housing density might have on neighborhood character and quality of life?", "answer": "honestly, it could go either way where I live in Lewistown, Pennsylvania because if they just start cramming buildings in without thinking well then yes it could definitely change the feel of some older neighborhoods i like. In my opinion more noise, less green space, etc. but if it\u2019s done thoughtfully maybe adding some smaller apartment buildings that fit it he existing houses might not be such a big deal. I think it could even bring some energy without losing the charm. I mean in general and in all honesty it really depends on how they go about it, if that makes sense at all!"}, {"question_number": "5", "question": "How do you think upzoning might affect transportation systems and traffic congestion in cities?", "answer": "in a bigger city I can only imagine it could be a lot worse if they added a bunch more people without also improving the roads or public transportation. More people means more cars that\u2019s just fact. So unless they really invest in things like buses or trains at the same time it\u2019s seems like up zoning could definitely make traffic a bigger problem in areas like the city!"}, {"question_number": "6", "question": "What role do you believe local government should play in regulating housing development and density?", "answer": "I think the local government plays a big role! mainly because they need to think long-term, just like all communities and nations and people do, not just what\u2019s happening right now. they should definitely listen to people and what they want for the town. Setting some rules bout how dense things can get, where new buildings can go, making sure there\u2019s enough parking spaces, also green space is very important too in my opinion. It\u2019s about finding a balance that literally works for everyone equally and fair!"}, {"question_number": "7", "question": "How might environmental concerns factor into decisions about urban density and zoning?", "answer": "well, for example, where I live in PA we care about keeping things clean and green. in larger and bigger cities it\u2019s probably even more important. I feel like they need to consider things like green spaces and maybe parks or just more trees along the streets. I think how the building is designed is important too. Things like using energy and making sure they\u2019re not blocking sunlight for other buildings. Also have to thing about managing waste and water PROPERLY! So it doesn\u2019t harm our environment."}, {"question_number": "8", "question": "What economic effects, both positive and negative, might result from changing zoning laws to allow more multi-family housing?", "answer": "Some positives would be more people living closer to downtown could mean more customers for our local shops and restaurants. Maybe some new buisnesses would open up to! Or could also create more construction jobs. On the downside it could change the character of the neighborhoods too much meaning that it might make some people who currently live here or there want to move out which could be bad for the local economy! property values could also possibly change which could ultimately affect property taxes. Feels like it\u2019s a bit like gambling."}, {"question_number": "9", "question": "How do you think the interests of current residents versus future residents should be balanced when making zoning decisions?", "answer": "You have people who have lived here their entire lives. They like things the way they are and their opinions matter.

Which might have better schools and education and better job opportunities. Thinking about social equity means making sure everyone has a fair shot at finding a decent place to live and access what the town has to offer.

Also the neighborhoods will be more walkable."}, {"question_number": "2", "question": "What do you think are the most significant impacts, positive or negative, of increasing housing density in residential neighborhoods?", "answer": "The housing crisis will ease, rents will be more affordable, houses will be more affordable, more families will form, neighborhoods will be more walkable, there will be less car traffic and pollution.  The bad effects are that there could be more noise and arguments and disagreements with neighbors on top of each other.  It could change the character of the neighborhood."}, {"question_number": "3", "question": "How do you think upzoning policies might affect housing affordability in urban areas?", "answer": "It is supply and demand.

In other words, don't build a tall building right next to someone's house that blocks the view and the sun.  However, if it is on a big lot, then yeah go ahead and let them build.

If you suddenly put in like 7, 8, 10 tall buildings, we don't really know what the impact is. You only benefit the builders and the local didn't really get a lot because you only have like 10, 15 affordable in each 10 buildings, then it's not a lot.

But those people, I think it's pretty short sighted, and they're only thinking about like, for, you know, 30%, you know, 15%, so-called affordable housing, and it's not a lot.

So we really need to think something else, not for the builders to do this, because 80% those profit will go to them, even the 20% is still probably profit for them in the long term, because it's so expensive nowadays.

I really do, especially in the smaller communities. Now on the outskirts of town where there's more property, more availability to put in some taller buildings that wouldn't obstruct some of these housing districts, would be a better option. So I think involving the community in each separate housing district, getting the views of the people, and making sure that there's a middle ground for everybody."}, {"question_number": "10", "question": "What role do you think social equity and access to opportunity play in discussions about zoning and housing policy?", "answer": "I don't think they play a role."}, {"question_number": "11", "question": "What factors do you think influence Support for Upzoning, and how strong is their impact?

The roads, the lights, the sidewalks, the trash, the utilities. All of it's dealt with, and the building, the people that are brought in, actually contribute to the community and not cause a problem.

Creating room for people in high-demand neighborhoods ensures diversity, which is crucial for a large city like Seattle.

Please explain your reasoning.", "answer": "I mostly support upzoning\u2014it can help with the housing shortage and make cities more affordable. But it needs to be done right. If it's rushed or poorly planned, it can mess with neighborhoods and not actually help lower-income folks. So yeah, good idea if it's done carefully"}, {"question_number": "2", "question": "What do you think are the most significant impacts, positive or negative, of increasing housing density in residential neighborhoods?", "answer": "I think the biggest positive impact is more housing options especially in places where rent is crazy high. It can also make neighborhoods more walkable and support local businesses.\nOn the flip side, a big negative is that it can put pressure on things like parking, schools, and traffic if cities don\u2019t plan for that stuff. Also, some people worry it\u2019ll change the \"feel\" of their neighborhood too much."}, {"question_number": "3", "question": "How do you think upzoning policies might affect housing affordability in urban areas?", "answer": "I think upzoning can help with affordability in theory more housing means less competition, so prices might go down or at least not rise as fast.\n\nBut it kinda depends on what gets built. If it\u2019s all high-end condos, it might not help much. For it to really improve affordability, cities need to include rules for affordable units or support mixed-income housing. Otherwise, it could just lead to more expensive places in new shapes."}, {"question_number": "4", "question": "What impact do you believe increased housing density might have on neighborhood character and quality of life?", "answer": "It could go both ways, honestly. More density might make a neighborhood feel more lively and bring in new shops, transit, stuff like that. That can be great for quality of life.\n\nBut it might also change the vibe like more noise, less parking, taller buildings where there used to be small houses.

Higher density can be good for the planet less sprawl means more green space stays untouched, and people might drive less if they live closer to work or transit.\nBut if cities don\u2019t plan well like not enough parks or poor waste systems it can hurt air quality or just make the area feel crowded and gross.

Both groups deserve a say, honestly."}, {"question_number": "10", "question": "What role do you think social equity and access to opportunity play in discussions about zoning and housing policy?", "answer": "If zoning just favors wealthier areas or excludes affordable housing, it can reinforce inequality and segregation.
